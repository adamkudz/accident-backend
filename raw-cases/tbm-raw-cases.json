    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 26, 2023, about 1000 eastern standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N850JH was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Ludington, Michigan. The pilot and pilot rated passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nAn instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed before the flight to fly from Mason County Airport (LDM) in Ludington, Michigan, to Tri-State Steuben County Airport (ANQ) in Angola, Indiana. The pilot also obtained an electronic weather briefing on the morning of the accident.  &#x0D;\nAccording to the airport manager, he assisted the pilot and pilot rated passenger in removing the airplane from a hangar on the airfield about 945. The airport manager reported that about 10 to 15 minutes later, the pilot taxied the airplane onto runway 8 and began the take-off roll. The airport manager said that the take-off appeared to be unremarkable except that the left wing dipped after rotation and the airplane continued to climb in a left bank. He watched the airplane until it disappeared into the clouds. The airport manager reported that it was snowing before and during the departure. According to an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) for LDM, the weather at the time of the accident was ¾ mile visibility, 400 ft cloud ceiling, and snow.&#x0D;\nA witness walking her dog about ½ mile north of the airport reported that she saw an airplane flying low overhead. The airplane was over the tree line with the left wing  perpendicular to the ground. The airplane disappeared behind the trees, and she heard a loud crash. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted a grassy area covered in mud and snow about ¼ mile north of Mason County Airport. A 10-foot tall, barbed wire fence, located east of the main wreckage exhibited torn and frayed wire. The airplane traveled about 110 ft from the impact site to the main wreckage and came to rest on its right side on a heading of about 120°. A crater about 10 inches deep and 36 inches long contained pieces of the left fuel tank and landing gear door and was located just west of the barbed wire fence. &#x0D;\nThe debris field, which was about 75 ft in length and 40 ft wide, was situated on an east to west heading and consisted of additional pieces of the left fuel tank, fragmented pieces of the left flap, left fuel tank sending unit, left wing root, one propeller blade, and left-wing tip. Most of the left wing was at the end of the debris field just before the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the engine, propeller hub, remaining propeller blades, fuselage, right wing, empennage, landing gear, and left aileron. All five composite propeller blades were impact separated at the hub. The hub was still attached to the gear box. Only one propeller blade was found in the debris field. The pieces of the propeller that were still attached at the hub, were ragged with a broom straw appearance cut at a 45°angle and packed with mud. The right aileron was still attached to the right wing. The landing gear was found in the up position. The left aileron trim was still attached to the left aileron and was in a neutral position. The G1000 flight deck, other avionics, and circuit breaker panel were consumed by post-impact fire. &#x0D;\nThe empennage included the vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizer, and elevator; however, the empennage was impact separated from the rest of the fuselage. The both the left and right elevator trim tabs showed an identical deflection, 1 cm down from the elevator main trailing edge. The rudder trim was set to close to the neutral position, .2 cm to the right. &#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was retained for further examination.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On April 7, 2023, about 1655 Pacific daylight time, a Compagnie Daher TBM 700 airplane (marketed as a TBM 940), N6924G, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Ashland Municipal Airport-Sumner Parker Field (S03), Ashland, OR. The pilot and pilot rated passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported he was 2.5 hours into a flight review in the accident airplane. The instructor gave the pilot a flight scenario that included a weather diversion to Ashland, Oregon. As the airplane approached the airport, the pilot established that the winds favored Runway 30. The pilot lowered the landing gear and extended his downwind leg in the pattern to assure a stabilized approach. He confirmed that the landing gear was down, full flaps were extended, and his approach speed was between 80 to 95 knots, with an engine torque greater than 10%.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the final approach leg was uneventful. After he crossed the pavement of Runway 30, the instructor announced to the pilot that there was a simulated obstruction on the runway and that he should perform a go-around.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot advanced engine power to 70% torque and established the airplane in a level flight attitude. He expected to see an increase in airspeed; however, almost immediately the airplane yawed to the left of the runway centerline. He depressed the right rudder but was unable to correct the movement. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane continued to lose altitude and impacted the left side of the runway in a level attitude and came to rest after it encountered bushes and small trees near the edge of a creek. The pilot side door was obstructed by sizable tree branches and the two pilots exited the passenger door. A small fire ensued eventually engulfing much of the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom the moment that the pilot increased power to terrain impact was approximately 3 to 5 seconds. &#x0D;\nThe pilot had accumulated about 2,650 hours as PIC, with 1400 hours in a TBM. He reported he had performed a go-around many times with and without instructors. There was never a stall warning indicator or any indication of impending loss of control.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was performing a short cross-country flight, which was his third solo flight in the high-performance single-engine airplane. The airplane departed and climbed to 20,000 ft mean sea level (msl) before beginning to descend. About 8 minutes before the accident, the airplane was southbound, descending to 11,000 ft, and the pilot established communications with air traffic control (ATC). About 4 minutes later, the controller cleared the pilot to descend to 10,000 ft msl and proceed direct to his destination; the pilot acknowledged the clearance. &#x0D;\nWhile descending through 13,000 ft msl, the airplane entered a descending left turn. The controller observed the left turn and asked the pilot if everything was alright; there was no response from the pilot. The controller’s further attempts to establish communications were unsuccessful. Following the descending left turn, the airplane entered a high speed, nose-down descent toward terrain. A witness observed the airplane at a high altitude in a steep nose-down descent toward the terrain. The witness noted no signs of distress, such as smoke, fire, or parts coming off the airplane, and he heard the airplane’s engine operating at full throttle. The airplane impacted two powerlines, trees, and the terrain in a shallow descent with a slightly left-wing low attitude.&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed a long debris field that was consistent with an impact at a high speed and relatively shallow flightpath angle. All major components of the airplane were located in the debris field at the accident site. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nA performance study indicated the airplane entered a left roll and dive during which the airplane exceeded the airspeed, load factor, and bank angle limitations published in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). An important but unknown factor during these maneuvers was the behavior of the pilot and his activity on the flight controls during the initial roll and dive. The pilot responded normally to ATC communications only 98 seconds before the left roll started. It is difficult to reconcile an alert and attentive pilot with the roll and descent that occurred, but there is insufficient information available to determine whether the pilot was incapacitated or distracted during any part of the roll and dive maneuver.&#x0D;\nAlthough all the available toxicological specimens contained ethanol (the alcohol contained in alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine), the levels were very low and below the allowable level for flight (0.04 gm/dl). While it is possible that some of the identified ethanol had been ingested, it is also possible that all or most of the identified ethanol was from sources other than ingestion (such as postmortem production). In either case, the levels were too low to have caused incapacitation. It is therefore unlikely that any effects from ethanol contributed to the circumstances of the accident. There was minimal available autopsy evidence to support any determination of incapacitation. As a result, it could not be determined from the available evidence whether medical incapacitation contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Airplane Performance Study&#x0D;\nAn Aircraft Performance and Simulation Study was completed by the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering. The study was based on ATC data, Garmin GTN 750 GPS device data, wreckage location and debris field evidence, weather information, airplane performance information from the POH, and output from aircraft performance analysis programs and simulations. The airplane was not equipped (and was not required to be equipped) with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder. No measures of the flight control inputs or engine power during the flight were available. However, the Garmin GTN 750 recorded many performance parameters, including altitude, position, ground speed and airspeed, Euler angles (heading, pitch, and roll), and vertical and lateral load factors. This information was used to define the trajectory of the airplane during its descent from 20,000 ft msl and sudden left turn and dive as it descended through 13,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\nThe airplane began its descent about 1433:00, while flying at 183 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) about 25 nautical miles (nm) north and 7 nm east of the accident site. The descent rate was relatively constant, about -1,600 ft/minute (ft/min), varying between -1,500 and -1,700 ft/min with oscillations between -1,150 and -1,850 ft/min during turns. During the descent, the airspeed increased to 200 KCAS at 1435:00, and then at 1435:40 increased further, reaching 235 KCAS at 1438:20 and 13,000 ft msl, just before the start of the left roll and final dive. Turns during the descent were consistent with the autopilot roll authority limits of 25° roll angle and 5°/second roll rate.&#x0D;\nThe position data recorded by the GTN 750 was consistent with recorded automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and radar data. For unexplained reasons, there were periodic 14 to 16 second gaps in the ADS-B data every 4 to 5 minutes during the flight, and the ADS-B data stopped entirely at 1437:28, about 83 seconds before the end of the GTN 750 data, as the airplane was descending through 14,100 ft msl, about 4.9 nm north of the accident site. The reason for the lapses in the ADS-B data is unknown.&#x0D;\nAt 1436:42, 98 seconds before the start of the final roll and dive, as the airplane was descending through 15,300 ft msl about 8 nm north of the accident site, the pilot made a final radio transmission to ATC. The content of the communication was appropriate and unremarkable.&#x0D;\nAt 1438:20.5, the airplane started rolling left about 7°/second (faster than the autopilot authority). The airplane continued rolling left at this rate until the roll angle reached about 110° left wing down, when the roll rate momentarily dropped back to zero. The roll angle then started to return towards wings-level, reaching 62° left wing down at 1438:49.7, and then remained relatively constant until the end of the GTN 750 data at 1438:51.7. During the roll maneuver, the pitch angle decreased from about 4.5° nose down at 14:38:20 to 31.5° nose down at 14:38:37, and it continued to decrease even as the roll angle lessened, reaching 53° nose down as the roll angle was returning through 80° left wing down. Thereafter the pitch angle started to increase, reaching 45° nose down at the end of the data.&#x0D;\nThe GTN 750 data ends at an altitude of about 4,200 ft msl, or 3,200 ft above the terrain elevation of about 1,000 ft msl. At the end of the data, the descent rate was about 30,000 ft/min but was apparently decreasing. The airplane was about 1 nm away from the impact location when the data ended, and simulations indicated that it would have taken about another 11 seconds to cover that distance. According to the NTSB GPS devices specialist, it is very common for the data recorded in avionics devices to end before impact because of the buffering process used in writing the data to storage media; the data loss can range from a few seconds up to a minute.&#x0D;\nThree different simulation scenarios were evaluated in the performance study, titled Controls, Imbalance, and Recovery. The Controls and Imbalance scenarios simulated the initial roll and dive up to the end of the GTN 750 data (from 1438:06 to 1438:52). The Recovery scenario continued the simulation past the end of the data and attempted to determine the flight control inputs that would result in the airplane arriving at the initial impact point in an attitude consistent with the accident site evidence.&#x0D;\nThe Controls scenario was performed using a symmetrical airplane loading (center of gravity on the airplane centerline). Based on the results, which showed very little yoke and wheel force required during the initial roll and dive, the Imbalance and Recovery scenarios were performed assuming a 420-pound (lb) fuel imbalance (left wing heavier). This imbalance resulted in a match of the initial roll when zero-wheel force was applied and simulated a situation in which the autopilot was holding wheel force against the fuel imbalance until 1438:20.5, but then disconnected for some reason. Assuming that the pilot did not intervene, the wheel force after the autopilot disconnect remained zero.&#x0D;\nThe Recovery scenario provided an estimate of performance parameters beyond the end of the GTN 750 data that were consistent with the final recorded data points and with the airplane heading, bank angle, and flight path angle evidenced by the impact point and long debris path. The scenario indicated that substantial wheel and column forces were required to maneuver the airplane from the state indicated by the end of the GTN 750 data to the impact point. &#x0D;\nThe Recovery scenario also indicated that the initial part of the maneuver could be approximately duplicated with zero control forces applied, together with either an aerodynamic or loading asymmetry and a disengaged autopilot. The low control forces required and irregularity of the maneuver itself suggested that the pilot might have been momentarily incapacitated or distracted between 1438:21 and 1438:37. However, the simulations also indicated that the pilot would have had to apply substantial wheel and column forces after 1438:37 to maneuver the airplane to the accident site. &#x0D;\nA turbulence encounter that produced a normal load factor of more than 1.6 Gs could have disengaged the autopilot. The GTN 750 data indicated that such an encounter might have occurred before the start of the left roll at 1438:20.5. If the autopilot was holding wheel force against a 420 pound fuel imbalance at the time it disconnected, a roll rate matching that recorded in the data would develop, unless the pilot intervened by applying force on the control wheel. A 420 pound fuel imbalance could result from burning fuel from only one tank for about 1.1 hours in cruise flight. &#x0D;\nIn the accident, an important but unknown factor was the behavior of the pilot and his activity (or lack thereof) on the flight controls during the initial roll and dive. Notably, the pilot responded normally to an ATC communication at 1436:42, only 98 seconds before the roll rate started to increase at 1438:20.5. However, it is difficult to reconcile an alert and attentive pilot with the roll and descent that followed. There was insufficient information available to determine whether a fuel asymmetry was present or whether the pilot was incapacitated or distracted for at least part of the roll and dive maneuver. - On August 6, 2021, maintenance personnel completed an “A+ inspection” and an annual inspection on the airframe, engine, and propeller in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance program. On August 19, 2021, at the request of the pilot, the pilot’s local maintenance company contracted with an FAA certified engine repair station to complete a borescope inspection of the engine’s turbine section. No defects were noted during the borescope inspection.&#x0D;\nAccording to flight tracking data and an associate, the pilot last refueled the airplane in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 14, 2021. After the refueling and before the accident flight, the pilot conducted two flights totaling about 1.5 hours. The amount of fuel remaining in each fuel tank after these flights was unknown. - On August 20, 2021, about 1440 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700A airplane, N700DT, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Urbana, Ohio. The pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nATC information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated the airplane was en route from the Erie-Ottawa Airport (PCW), Port Clinton, Ohio, to the Cincinnati Municipal Airport (LUK), Cincinnati, Ohio. At 1412, the airplane departed runway 9 at PCW and climbed to 20,000 ft msl before beginning to descend. At 1432, the airplane was southbound, descending to 11,000 ft msl, and the pilot established communications with the assigned terminal radar approach control controller. &#x0D;\nAbout 1436, the controller cleared the pilot to descend to 10,000 ft msl and proceed direct to LUK. The pilot acknowledged the clearance, and about 98 seconds later, while descending through 13,000 ft msl, the airplane entered a left turn. At 1438, the controller observed the left turn and asked the pilot if everything was alright; there was no response from the pilot. Radar contact was subsequently lost with the airplane, and the controller’s further attempts to establish communications were unsuccessful.&#x0D;\nA witness located about 2 miles south of the accident location stated that he observed the airplane at a high altitude in a nose-dive descent toward the terrain. He reported the airplane was not turning or spinning; it was headed straight down. The witness observed no signs of distress, such as smoke, fire, or parts coming off the airplane, and he stated the airplane’s engine was at full throttle. The witness lost sight of the airplane as it descended behind some trees.&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located 1.3 miles northwest of the last radar contact, and on scene evidence indicated the airplane impacted two powerlines, trees, and the terrain in a shallow descent with a slightly left-wing low attitude. (See figures 1 and 2.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident site and initial impact point - According to the autopsy report issued by the Coroner of Montgomery County, Ohio, the pilot’s cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. The examination was significantly limited by the extent of injury; the brain and heart were not available for examination.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified ethanol at 0.018 gm/dl in cavity blood; 0.010 mg/hg in liver; and 0.020 mg/hg in lung. No other tested for substances were detected. &#x0D;\nEthanol is a social drug commonly consumed by drinking beer, wine, or liquor. It acts as a central nervous system depressant; it impairs judgement, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance. Ethanol is water soluble, and after absorption it quickly and uniformly distributes throughout the body’s tissues and fluids. The distribution pattern parallels water content and blood supply of the tissue. Ethanol may be produced by body tissues after death by microbial activity (postmortem production). Extensive trauma increases the spread of bacteria and raises the risk of ethanol production after death. - No significant meteorological information, precipitation, or other forecast issues were reported in the area about the time of the accident. The reported weather included scattered cloud top levels were between 7,000 ft and 9,000 ft msl. - According to the pilot’s associates, he purchased the airplane about 9 days before the accident. Before the purchase, the pilot had owned and piloted Piper PA-46-310P/350P airplanes for about 20 years. &#x0D;\nAfter purchasing the airplane, the pilot and a flight instructor completed several hours of ground school and 15.5 hours of dual instruction in the airplane. The pilot and flight instructor had known each other for about 20 years and previously trained in the pilot’s Piper airplanes. The instructor stated the pilot was a “good student, in good health, and comfortable on the airplane’s systems.” The instructor advised the pilot to fly the airplane for about 10 to 15 hours by himself to get comfortable and not to fly in marginal weather.&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the pilot’s third solo flight in the airplane, and he had planned to pick up a family member at LUK. - The initial ground scar, located in a residential yard, contained separated components of the left wing. From the initial ground scar, a debris path continued across a highway, through trees and a ditch, and then continued into mature potato and soybean fields. The airplane wreckage, which was highly fragmented, was scattered over a distance of about 2,050 ft along a measured magnetic heading of 275°. An odor of Jet A aviation fuel was noted at the accident site by first responders.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit and fuselage were fragmented by impact forces. Flight control cable continuity could not be established due to the fragmentation of the airplane. All sections of the cables and push-pull tubes located in the wreckage exhibited tensile overload fractures. The primary and secondary flight control surfaces were fragmented and located in the debris field. The forward lower left fuselage skin displayed scrape marks consistent with contacting the highway road surface. The cabin and emergency doors were separated from the fuselage structure. The main cabin door locking pins were extended, and the door handle was in the closed position. The right main landing gear actuator was found locked in the UP position.&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory examined the light bulbs in the cockpit annunciator panel. The panel contained 30 individual annunciators, each of which contained 2 bulbs. One annunciator was missing from the panel. The individual annunciator lights were removed from the panel and x-rayed to determine the status of the filaments. None of the bulb filaments exhibited hot filament stretch. &#x0D;\nThe left wing was separated at the wing root and fragmented. The left flap and aileron were separated from the wing. The forward and rear spars of the left wing were bent aft from their original positions. The right wing was separated near the wing root and was fragmented into two sections. The right flap and aileron were separated from the wing. The flap jackscrew was found in the flaps UP position. The left and right horizontal stabilizers were separated, and the vertical stabilizer remained partially attached to the aft fuselage structure. The left elevator was separated; the right elevator remained partially attached; and the rudder remained attached to the vertical stabilizer. The rudder trim was found in a neutral position, and the elevator trim was about in the full nose up position.  &#x0D;\nThe engine accessory gearbox and forward propeller shaft were separated from the engine and located in the debris field. Multiple parts of the power turbine section and the compressor section exhibited rotational scoring. Multiple compressor impeller blades were bent opposite the direction of travel.&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub was separated from the engine propeller shaft. All five blades were separated from the hub, and a portion of each blade was found in the wreckage. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airplane was in cruise flight at FL280 when the instrument-rated pilot failed to contact air traffic control (ATC) following a frequency change assignment. After about 25 minutes, and when 30 miles east of the destination airport, the pilot contacted ATC on a frequency other than the one that was assigned. He requested the instrument landing system (ILS) approach at his intended destination, and the controller instructed the pilot to descend to 8,000 ft and to expect vectors for the ILS approach at the destination airport. The controller asked the pilot if everything was “okay,” to which the pilot replied, “yes sir, everything is fine.” The controller then observed the airplane initiate a descent. About 2 minutes later, the controller asked the pilot where he was headed, and the pilot provided a garbled response. The controller instructed the pilot to stop his descent at 10,000 ft, followed by an instruction to stop the descent at any altitude. The pilot did not respond, and additional attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. The airplane impacted terrain in a heavily wooded area 17 miles from the destination airport. &#x0D;\nAll major components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the main wreckage. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nThe investigation was unable to determine why the pilot was not in contact with ATC for 25 minutes. The pilot’s eventual contact with ATC about 30 miles from his intended destination, while still operating at his cruise altitude, suggests a clear breakdown in awareness of his position through distraction or impairment. However, upon re-establishing contact with ATC, the pilot’s communications were clear, nominal, and timely, which did not suggest impairment or use of an oxygen mask. Additionally, in response to a direct query from ATC the pilot did not indicate any difficulty. Further, there was no sign of airframe depressurization and examination of the wreckage did not reveal deployment of the passenger oxygen masks. Toxicology results were positive for ethanol at a low level, which was likely due to post-mortem production. &#x0D;\nMeteorological data and a performance study indicated that the pilot initiated a descent through multiple cloud layers about 15 seconds after acknowledging the descent clearance. During the initial portion of the airplane’s descent, its airspeed and rate of descent appeared to be nominal. About 2 minutes later, excessive airspeeds, descent rates, bank angles, and pitch attitudes were achieved. The performance study depicted the airplane entering a spiral dive during which the airplane exceeded airspeed, maneuvering, structural, and autopilot limitations. At 6,000 ft above ground level, and about 10 seconds before ground contact, the airplane descended through a final cloud layer, the descent profile shallowed, and the rate of descent decreased to 6,800 ft/min before radar data ended. &#x0D;\nIn addition, there were no clearances issued by ATC that would have required the pilot to change either the airplane’s rate of descent or track about this time; however, the airplane’s proximity to the destination airport may have created a heightened sense of urgency for the pilot to descend and or configure his avionics for the approach, which may have served as an operational distraction. Although it was possible that restrictions to visibility during the descent may have affected the pilot’s ability to maintain positive airplane control, there is insufficient information to determine how or why the pilot lost control.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Performance Study&#x0D;\nA performance study was conducted using airplane weight, radar, communications, and weather data. The results indicated the airplane was in cruise flight at 28,000 ft and about 190 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) until 1141:17, when over a 30-second span, the nose pitched down about 10° and the rate of descent increased to 4,500 ft/minute. The descent was initiated 15 seconds after the airplane was cleared to descend from its cruising altitude. The airplane maintained its assigned heading until 1143:31. At that time, the airplane descended through 19,300 ft and accelerated through its maximum operating speed of 271 KCAS. &#x0D;\nThe study showed that the airplane then entered a right banking turn that reached nearly 90°, with a pitch-down attitude of 47°. Both airspeed and rate of descent increased in the descending turn. Airspeed reached 350 KCAS and the rate of descent peaked at 28,400 ft/min at 1144:13, and then decreased to 6,800 ft/min at the end of the data. The computed normal load factor increased to about 3.8 G during the descent. The study noted the descent profile was consistent with a spiral dive.&#x0D;\nLimitations&#x0D;\nAccording to the manufacturer, the airplane autopilot engagement limitation for angle of bank was +/-45° and -15° for descending pitch angle. In addition, the autopilot operational envelope (commands limit) was +/- 25° for bank angle and -10° for descending pitch angle. Furthermore, the airplane was equipped with an emergency descent mode that, when engaged, would signal the autopilot to initiate a 90° left turn and descent up to 4,000 ft/min (depending on airplane loading, power lever positions, and weather conditions) until the airplane reached the target altitude of 15,000 ft msl. &#x0D;\n - According to FAA records, the pilot purchased the airplane in June 2016. It was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D, 850-horsepower engine equipped with a Hartzell constant-speed propeller. &#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane flight manual, the airplane was equipped with an altimetric valve that provided an automatic passenger mask actuation function at a cabin altitude between 13,000 ft and 14,000 ft when the oxygen switch was set to ON.&#x0D;\n - On October 2, 2020, at 1144 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N965DM, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Corfu, New York. The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was serviced with 173 gallons of Jet A fuel on the morning of the accident, which filled the tanks. The first flight departed Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF), Buffalo, New York, at 0747 and landed at Manchester Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, at 0914, where the passenger was boarded. No services were received before the airplane departed on the accident flight.&#x0D;\nRadar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depicted its departure at 1019, and a climb to flight level (FL) 280 where it remained in level flight. Air traffic control (ATC) voice communication data revealed the pilot checked in with the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center following a frequency change issued by a previous controller, and about 25 minutes elapsed before the pilot established communication with Buffalo Approach Control when he was about 30 miles east of BUF.&#x0D;\nOn the initial contact, the pilot told the radar controller he had lost communication with center and was level at FL280. About 1141, the controller instructed him to descend to 8,000 ft and to expect the instrument landing system (ILS) runway 23 approach; radar data show the airplane began its descent about this time. A few seconds later, the controller asked the pilot if “everything was okay...” and the pilot responded, “yes sir, everything’s fine.” The controller then cleared the pilot to fly direct to BUF and to expect vectors for a left downwind t0 the runway 23 ILS. The pilot acknowledged this clearance. &#x0D;\nAbout 2 minutes later, the controller asked the pilot where he was headed, and the pilot provided a “garbled” response. The controller then instructed the pilot to stop his descent and to maintain 10,000 ft, followed by an instruction to stop his descent and to maintain any altitude. The pilot did not respond, and several additional attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. &#x0D;\nWitnesses in the area surrounding the crash site reported that the engine sound was “very loud” before the sound of impact was heard.&#x0D;\n - According to the autopsy report from the Office of the Medical Examiner, Monroe County, New York, the cause of the pilot’s death was multiple blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was accident. The examination was limited by the extensive injuries.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected ethanol in the pilot’s muscle tissue at 0.022 grams per hectogram (gm/hg). No other tested for drugs were detected in his muscle tissue. Toxicology testing performed for the medical examiner’s office was negative for ethanol and tested for drugs in the pilot’s muscle tissue. &#x0D;\nEthanol is a social drug commonly consumed by drinking beer, wine, or liquor. It acts as a central nervous system depressant; it impairs judgment, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance. Ethanol is water soluble, and after absorption it quickly and uniformly distributes throughout the body’s tissues and fluids. The distribution pattern parallels water content and blood supply of the tissue. Ethanol can be produced after death by microbial activity; sometimes in conjunction with other alcohols, such as propanol. Extensive trauma increases the spread of bacteria and raises the risk of ethanol production after death.&#x0D;\n - The 1154 recorded weather observation at BUF, located about 17 miles west of the accident location, included wind from 250° at 9 knots, visibility 10 miles, few clouds at 2,000 ft above ground level (agl) and 3,500 ft agl, broken cloud layers at 6,000 ft agl and 14,000 ft agl, temperature 13°C, dew point 8°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\nAccording to high-resolution rapid refresh model sounding for the accident site around 1200, the wind at FL190 was from the west about 25 knots. Relative humidity about FL190 was 33% and the relative humidity was above 90% for the entire atmosphere above about 9,000 ft. The freezing level was identified as about 5,200 ft. Calculations made by the Rawinsonde Observation Program (RAOB) did not identify any potential for icing, clouds, or significant turbulence between about 9,000 and 27,000 ft.&#x0D;\n - The pilot reported having flown 60 hours during the 6 months before his last FAA medical examination. The pilot’s logbook reflected a flight on May 20, 2019, and completion of a SimCom recurrent course for the TBM850 on February 9, 2020. A summary of the logbook review revealed the pilot’s hours of flight experience during the 4 years prior to the accident.&#x0D;\nYear&#x0D;\nTotal Flight Hours&#x0D;\nTBM Flight Hours&#x0D;\n2016&#x0D;\n100.2&#x0D;\n90.1&#x0D;\n2017&#x0D;\n53.9&#x0D;\n53.9&#x0D;\n2018&#x0D;\n70.1&#x0D;\n70.1&#x0D;\n2019&#x0D;\n25.1&#x0D;\n25.1&#x0D;\n - The airplane impacted a heavily wooded, swampy area. The airplane was fragmented and damaged by postcrash fire. Wreckage and components of the airplane were buried 15 ft below the surface. All of the major components were accounted for at the scene. An odor of Jet A aviation fuel was noted at the accident site by first responders.&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was fragmented by impact forces. The door locking pins on the main cabin door were extended and the door handle was in the closed position. A passenger emergency oxygen mask was located separated from the airframe, but the mask remained inside its housing. Control cable continuity could not be confirmed due to the fragmentation of the fuselage. All sections of the cables and push-pull tubes located exhibited tensile overload fractures. The autopilot aileron and trip servos were located, and all cables exhibited tensile overload failures. A majority of each primary and secondary flight control surfaces were in the fragmented wreckage. &#x0D;\nBoth the forward and aft sections of the center wing spar were bent symmetrically about 43° aft from their original positions. The left elevator trim tab was separated from the left elevator and located in four sections. The inboard section of the right elevator trim remained attached to the elevator. The elevator trim actuators were located and measured 16mm, consistent with a neutral position. The rudder was impact separated from the vertical stabilizer. The top section of the rudder and rudder trim tab were not located. The tailcone was impact separated and located in the wreckage. &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the accessory gearbox and inlet case were impact-separated, and they were not located. Multiple parts of the power turbine section and compressor section of the engine exhibited rotational scoring. Multiple blades were fractured, smeared, and bent the opposite direction of travel. The fracture surfaces that were not smeared exhibited features consistent with overload.&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub was impact-separated from the engine. All five blades were impact-separated from the hub. A portion of each of the five blades was found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting an instrument approach at the conclusion of a cross-country flight when the airplane entered a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading about 0.5-mile from the intended runway. According to airspeeds calculated from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast position data, the airplane’s calibrated airspeed was 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix inbound toward the runway and was about 84 knots when it was on a 0.5-mile final approach. The airplane continued to decelerate to 74 knots while it was in a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. At no point during the approach did the pilot maintain the airframe manufacturer’s specified approach speed of 85 knots. The airplane impacted the ground in an open grass field located to the left of the extended runway centerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain in a wings level attitude. The postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe altitude and airspeed trends during the final moments of the flight were consistent with the airplane entering an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. Based on the configuration of the airplane at the accident site, the pilot likely was retracting the landing gear and flaps for a go-around when the airplane entered the aerodynamic stall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight, and past the aft center-of-gravity limit at the time of the accident which can render the airplane unstable and difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.  Additionally, without a timely corrective rudder input, the airplane tends to roll left after a rapid application of thrust at airspeeds less than 70 knots, including during aerodynamic stalls. Although an increase in thrust is required for a go-around, the investigation was unable to determine how rapidly the pilot increased thrust, or if a torque-roll occurred during the aerodynamic stall.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Weight and Balance Effects&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook, if the CG is maintained within the allowable limits for an airplane’s weight, the airplane would have adequate longitudinal stability and control. If a loaded airplane results in a CG that is aft of the allowable limits, the airplane can become unstable and would be difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPropeller Thrust-Required Estimates&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller manufacturer provided thrust-required estimates based on the airplane’s weight, altitude, airspeed, and airframe drag. The thrust estimates suggest the powerplant was running, capable of generating thrust, and responding to airframe configuration changes/power lever inputs necessary to maintain the approach path until the final moments of the flight. The average estimated propeller thrust over the final 11 recorded ADS-B data points was 412 lbs. The average flight condition during those final recorded data points were about 1,050 ft pressure altitude and 82 knots true airspeed. Assuming a propeller speed of 2,000 RPM, the engine power required to generate 412 pounds of thrust with those flight conditions is about 170 horsepower (24% torque) at about 15.6° propeller blade angle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSafety Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn February 2014, the French Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA) published a study concerning loss of control accidents involving Socata TBM 700 airplanes. The study reviewed 36 accidents, of which 6 involved a loss of control and left roll during final approach. In several of the accidents, the airplane deviated left of the intended flight path shortly before impact. The accidents generally involved the airplane flying at a low airspeed while in the landing configuration, combined with a rapid increase in thrust. The study highlighted a tendency for the Socata TBM 700 airplane to start rolling to the left, controllably, during go-around while at airspeeds equal to or greater than 70 knots, and from a fully reduced engine torque or adjusted to 20%. However, the left rolling tendency becomes increasingly pronounced as the airspeed decreases below 70 knots. A demonstration flight revealed that without corrective rudder input after a rapid application of thrust the airplane tended to roll to the left during an aerodynamic stall. The study acknowledged that a left roll during an aerodynamic stall is a recognized phenomenon associated with single engine airplanes, and that the Socata TBM 700 airplane design complied with federal regulations that limited how much left roll can be encountered during an aerodynamic stall. The study suggested that additional pilot training at slow airspeeds could be beneficial in preventing similar accidents in the future.&#x0D;\n - Weight and Balance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had a total fuel capacity of 290.6 gallons (281.6 gallons usable). According to available fueling and historical flight information, the airplane had about 202 gallons (1,374 lbs) of fuel onboard before the flight departed. Based on historical fuel consumption data, the airplane used about 70 gallons (476 lbs) during the 58 minute accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the current weight-and-balance record, dated May 24, 2017, the airplane had an empty weight of 4,674.28 lbs and a useful load of 2,719.92 lbs. The empty weight center-of-gravity (CG) was 187.17 inches aft of the datum. At maximum takeoff weight, 7,394 lbs, the forward and aft CG limits were 187 inches and 193.65 inches, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane's weight and balance at takeoff were calculated using the reported weights and seat positions for the pilot and the 5 passengers, and 202 gallons (1,374 lbs) of fuel. The takeoff weight and CG location were estimated to be 7,626.28 lbs and 196.18 inches, respectively. At takeoff, the airplane was about 232 lbs over the maximum allowable takeoff weight and about 2.53 inches past the aft CG limit. The engine burned about 70 gallons (476 lbs) of fuel during the flight. The estimated airplane weight and CG location at the time of impact were 7,150.28 lbs and 196.60 inches, respectively. At impact, the airplane was about 126 lbs over the maximum allowable landing weight and 2.95 inches past the aft CG limit (Figure 4).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Weight and Balance Calculations and Plot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAerodynamic Stall Speed&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Socata TBM 700 C2 Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), Supplement No. 41, the aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps extended for landing is 65 knots. The aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps extended for takeoff is 77 knots. The aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps retracted is 83 knots. The approach speed with flaps in the landing position is 85 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight and past the aft CG limit. The airplane manufacturer provided calculated aerodynamic stall speeds for the airplane using the weight (7,150.28 lbs) and center-of-gravity position (196.60 inches) at the time of the accident. The aerodynamic stall speed was estimated to be about 62 knots with landing gear and flaps extended for landing, 74 knots with the landing gear and flaps extended for takeoff, and 79 knots with the landing gear and flaps retracted.&#x0D;\n - On October 3, 2019, about 0858 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700 C2 airplane, N700AQ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Lansing, Michigan. The commercial pilot and four passengers were fatally injured; and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data, about 0800, the flight departed runway 19 at Indy South Greenwood Airport (HFY), Greenwood, Indiana, turned northeast toward MAREO intersection, and then turned north toward Capital Region International Airport (LAN), Lansing, Michigan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane subsequently climbed to flight level 190 (19,000 ft pressure altitude). At 0834:24, the flight entered a cruise descent from flight level 190 and was progressively cleared down to 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control communications, the flight was provided radar vectors to join the localizer for the instrument landing system (ILS) runway 10R approach at LAN. The published inbound course for the ILS runway 10R approach at LAN was 96° magnetic, the crossing altitude for the final approach fix (FAMLI) was 2,367 ft msl, the distance between FAMLI and the runway 10R threshold was 4.5 miles, and the decision altitude was 1,061 ft msl (200 ft above ground level).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0853:03, the approach controller stated, \"TBM zero alpha quebec, five miles from FAMLI, turn right, ah, right heading zero seven zero, maintain three thousand until established on the localizer, cleared the ILS one zero right.\" The pilot responded, \"zero seven zero, ah, we're cleared for the ILS ten right into, ah, Lansing.\" The ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a right turn and joined the localizer inbound.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0854:27, the approach controller stated, \"TBM zero alpha quebec, contact Lansing tower one one niner point niner, good day.\" The pilot responded, \"One nineteen ninety, seven hundred alpha quebec.\" At 0855:29, the airplane crossed over FAMLI at 2,303 ft msl and continued to descend on the glideslope while established inbound on the localizer toward runway 10R. The airplane had a calculated calibrated airspeed of 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix. Between 0855:29 and 0857:45, while inbound on the instrument approach, the airplane continued to decelerate from 166 knots to 74 knots, as shown in figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Altitude and airspeed during instrument approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0854:36, the pilot established contact with the LAN tower controller and reported that the airplane was established on the ILS runway 10R instrument approach. At 0854:39, the tower controller stated, \"seven zero zero alpha quebec, Lansing, ah, tower, the winds are calm, one zero right cleared to land.\" The pilot responded, \"Cleared to land, ah, ten right, seven hundred alpha quebec.\" There were no additional communications received from the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ADS-B data indicated that at 0857:06 the airplane was about 1.3 miles from the runway threshold at 1,250 ft msl (about 400 ft above the runway elevation) and established on the localizer inbound to the runway. At 0857:37, the airplane was 0.5 miles from the runway threshold at 1,047 ft msl (about 180 ft above the runway elevation) and 84 knots when it entered a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. Between 0857:37 and 0857:45, the airplane climbed to 1,059 ft msl and decelerated to 74 knots, as shown in figure 2. At 0857:45, the final ADS-B datapoint was located about 315 ft north of the localizer centerline and 0.35 miles west of the runway 10R threshold. The final ADS-B datapoint was about 475 ft southwest of the initial impact point with terrain. Figure 3 shows ADS-B position data during the airplane’s final approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Altitude and airspeed during final approach. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. ADS-B position data during final approach.  &#x0D;\n - The pilot received his commercial pilot certificate on May 8, 2019. The pilot’s last instrument proficiency check was completed in a Redbird SR22 simulator on September 12, 2019. He completed the SIMCOM TBM 700 initial course on September 30, 2018. According to the pilot's logbook, he had flown 76.4 hours and 9.8 hours in Socata TBM 700 and TBM 850 airplanes, respectively. The pilot had logged all his Socata TBM 700 flight time during the year before the accident.&#x0D;\n - The accident site was in an open grass field located about 0.3 miles west-northwest of the runway 10R threshold. The initial impact point was in a large, depressed grass area that preceded a 135-ft-long ground scar oriented on a 060° bearing. The initial impact area measured 42 ft wide, consistent with the wingspan of the airplane (figure 5). The lower VHF antenna, the left main landing gear door, and several flap track fairings were located along the wreckage debris path.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Initial impact point and ground scar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Main airplane wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the entire airplane (figure 6). Both wings and the empennage remained attached to the fuselage. All flight control surfaces remained attached to their respective hinges. Flight control continuity for the elevator, rudder, and right aileron were confirmed from each flight control surface to the forward cabin. Flight control continuity to the left aileron could not be established due to impact damage; the observed cable separations near the left wing root were consistent with overstress. Both spoilers were retracted and remained connected to their respective ailerons. Both the rudder and elevator trim surfaces were found in their neutral positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flap selector was found in the up and locked position. The wing flap actuator jack screws were found about halfway between the takeoff and landing positions. The landing gear selector switch was found in the gear-up position. The left main landing gear and nose gear were fully retracted and on their respective actuator uplocks. The right main landing gear was retracted into its wheel well, but the right gear was not secured by its respective actuator uplock.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle was found in the flight idle position, the propeller lever was full forward, and the condition lever was full forward. The fuel manual override was closed and gated. The fuel system switch was found on AUTO, and the engine was using fuel from the left fuel tank at the time of impact. Both fuel tanks ruptured during impact and there was a strong odor of Jet A aviation fuel at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to its respective engine mounts. There was a complete fracture of the propeller shaft and reduction gearbox housing forward of the 2nd stage reduction gears. There was evidence that engine oil was discharged out of the engine after impact; engine oil was found on the outside of the engine cowling, windscreen, and extending 20 ft in front of the engine (Figure 7). There was compressive impact damage to the exhaust case at the 6 o'clock position. Engine control continuity was established from the cockpit to the fuel control unit. The propeller speed setting lever and reset cables were found separated from the propeller governor, but these cables moved freely when the associated cockpit levers were moved by hand. The compressor rotor turned freely with no anomalies and had continuity with the accessory gearbox. Fuel discharged from hoses when the fuel pump was rotated. The fuel filter bowl was about one-half full, and the fuel appeared clear with no significant debris or phase separation. Both magnetic chip detectors were free of any metallic particles. Some minor foreign object debris was found on the leading edge of several first-stage compressor blades and vegetation debris in the inlet screen. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe compressor turbine (CT) and power turbine (PT) were intact with all blades present. There were rotational contact signatures observed on the CT blades downstream platforms from contact with the inner shroud of the upstream side of the 1st stage PT vane ring. The first-stage PT blade tips displayed rubbing, with corresponding rubbing observed on the shroud at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. Some of the upstream blade platforms displayed rubbing with the inner shroud of the downstream side of the first-stage PT vane ring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7. Overview Photo of the Engine and Propeller at Accident Site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller assembly remained attached to the engine propeller shaft that fractured from the engine reduction gear box during impact. One propeller blade was bent in the forward/thrust direction. The remaining three propeller blades were bent in the aft direction. All four propeller blades exhibited chordwise/rotational scoring on the camber side with paint discoloration from the tip to the outboard end of the deice boot. Three blades exhibited chordwise/rotational scoring on the face side. The spinner dome was dented adjacent to one propeller blade with a counterweight impression area with the center/average angle of about 44°. The pitch change rod was in the feathered position. Three propeller blades could be rotated by hand force due to fractured pitch change mechanisms. One propeller blade had been forcefully rotated beyond the reverse stop position, two blades were in a low-pitch position, and one blade was in a feathered position. The beta ring appeared intact and undamaged with the carbon block and beta arm in position. The beta arm and valve moved freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and passenger were conducting a cross-country flight in the pilot's newly-purchased and refurbished World War II-era airplane when the engine experienced vibrations, smoke, an oil leak, and a partial loss of power. The airplane was over remote, rugged, tree-covered terrain with no emergency landing areas, and the occupants, who were wearing emergency parachutes, egressed about 1,500 ft above ground level. Both the pilot and passenger sustained serious injuries during their landings under parachute. Radar data indicated that the airplane continued a steady descent into terrain. The wreckage was never located despite numerous searches; therefore, the engine could not be examined and the reason for the loss of engine power or smoke and vibrations could not be determined. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 6, 2018, about 1338 mountain standard time, a Grumman TBM-3E airplane, N337VT, was presumed destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona. The private pilot and pilot-rated passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot was relocating the newly-purchased airplane from California to Illinois. The airplane had undergone refurbishment and condition inspections during the previous 6 months. Before the flight, the airplane was loaded with emergency and survival gear and the pilot and passenger watched the parachute manufacturer's safety video. &#x0D;\nOn the morning of the accident, the pilot flew from Zamperini Field Airport (TOA), Torrance, California, to Ak-Chin Regional Airport (A39), Maricopa, Arizona. After refueling, the pilot departed A39 and climbed to an altitude between 11,500 ft and 12,000 ft mean sea level (msl). About 45 minutes into the flight, the pilot heard a loud bang with vibrations and thick smoke entered the cockpit. He stated that the engine was operating, but not producing enough power to maintain altitude. The passenger stated that he saw sheets of oil exiting the right side of the engine cowling. As the airplane descended, they determined that there were no safe landing areas due to trees and rugged terrain, and decided to egress about 1,500 ft above ground level (agl). &#x0D;\nThe passenger exited first, followed by the pilot. Both parachutes deployed successfully; however, the pilot and passenger received serious injuries after landing in trees and falling to the ground, and were unable to call for rescue due to the lack of cell phone coverage in the area. The following morning, about 1100, a fire service truck passing through the area found the pilot and passenger and they were subsequently transported to a nearby medical facility via ambulance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control radar data revealed that the airplane continued eastbound on a stable, descending flight path after the pilot and passenger egressed. The last radar return at 1337:44 was at 10,000 ft msl, (about 1,900 ft agl) 19 miles east of Whiteriver Airport (E24), Whiteriver, Arizona, and 8 miles southwest of Mount Baldy. Multiple air and ground searches were conducted; however, the airplane was not located.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting an instrument approach following a 3.5-hour cross-country instrument flight rules (IFR) flight in a single-engine turboprop airplane. About 1.6 miles from the runway threshold, the airplane began a climb consistent with the published missed approach procedure; however, rather than completing the slight left climbing turn toward the designated holding point, the airplane continued in an approximate 270° left turn, during which the airplane's altitude varied, before entering a descending right turn and impacting terrain. Tree and ground impact signatures were consistent with a 60° nose-low attitude at the time of impact. No distress calls were received or recorded from the accident flight. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather information for the time of the accident revealed that the pilot was operating in IFR to low IFR conditions with gusting surface winds, light to heavy snow, mist, cloud ceilings between 700 and 1,400 ft above ground level with clouds extending through 18,500 ft, and the potential for low-level wind shear and clear air turbulence. The area of the accident site was under AIRMETs for IFR conditions, mountain obscuration, moderate icing below 20,000 ft, and moderate turbulence below 18,000 ft. In addition, a winter storm warning was issued about 6 hours before the flight departed. Although the pilot received a weather briefing about 17 hours before the accident, there was no indication that he obtained updated weather information before departure or during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation; however, the extent of the fire damage precluded examination of the avionics system. The airplane was equipped with standby flight instruments.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn acquaintance of the pilot reported that the pilot had experienced an avionics malfunction several months before the accident during which the airplane's flight display went blank while flying an instrument approach. During that occurrence, the pilot used ForeFlight on his iPad to maneuver back to the northeast and fly the approach again using his own navigation. During the accident flight, the airplane appeared to go missed approach, but rather than fly the published missed approach procedure, the airplane also turned left towards to northeast. However, it could not be determined if the pilot's actions were an attempt to fly the approach using his own navigation or if he was experiencing spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe restricted visibility and turbulence present at the time of the accident provided conditions conducive to the development of spatial disorientation. Additionally, the airplane's turning flight track and steep descent profile are consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Interview with the Airport Manager&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe EVW airport manager stated that the pilot had told him of a flight, several months before the accident, during which the airplane's flight display went blank during an instrument approach. On that day, the weather was marginal visual flight rules with light snow, and the pilot had ForeFlight on his iPad, which he used to make a left turn back toward the northeast and set up to fly the approach again. The pilot said he was going to have an avionics shop troubleshoot the issue. The airport manager did not hear anything further about an avionics problem, and review of the airplane's maintenance log did not find any recorded entry for avionics work.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airport manager stated that, around 1455 on the day of the accident, he heard what he assumed to be the accident airplane click the mic 5 times, then a few seconds later, click the mic 3 times on the airport's common traffic advisory frequency, consistent with the pilot activating the airport's pilot-controlled lighting system. A few minutes later, he heard a 10-second transmission during which he thought he could hear a woman's voice in the background before the transmission ended. There was no distress call.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute's publication, \"Introduction to Aviation Physiology,\" defines spatial disorientation as a loss of proper bearings or a state of mental confusion as to position, location, or movement relative to the position of the earth. Factors contributing to spatial disorientation include changes in acceleration, flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), frequent transfer between VMC and IMC, and unperceived changes in aircraft attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, chapter 16,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAeromedical Factors,\" stated, \"Under normal flight conditions, when there is a visual reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the aircraft. When visual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual references outside the aircraft, there are many situations in which normal motions and forces create convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome…Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight should be avoided in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is not visible. A pilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions through training and awareness and learning to rely totally on flight instruments. - The airplane was manufactured in 1997 and was modified under supplemental type certificate with an MT Propeller MTV-21-1-E 5-bladed propeller and a Garmin G600 avionics system, which included digital primary flight and multifunction displays. Standby instruments were available on the right outermost portion of the instrument panel. The most recent maintenance was a 200-hour inspection completed on September 27, 2017, at a Hobbs meter time of 3,966.5 hours. The pilot purchased the airplane in June 2017. - On February 18, 2018, about 1505 mountain standard time, a Socata TBM-700A airplane, N700VX, impacted terrain during an instrument approach to Evanston-Uinta County Airport/Burns Field (EVW), Evanston, Wyoming. The commercial pilot and passenger were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was privately owned and operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Instrument meteorological conditions existed at the airport, and the flight operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight departed Tulsa International Airport (TUL), Tulsa, Oklahoma, about 1210 central standard time (1110 mountain standard time).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar and air traffic control information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) captured the accident flight as it progressed. Initially, the pilot filed Centennial Airport, Englewood, Colorado, as the flight's destination. About 20 minutes after takeoff, the pilot requested to change the destination to Pueblo Memorial Airport (PUB), Pueblo, Colorado. An hour and 20 minutes later, the pilot again requested to change his destination to Provo Municipal Airport (PVU) due to weather. At 1353, the pilot requested to make EVW his new destination stating that EVW was below minimums when he departed, but that the weather had improved. At 1422, the controller asked the pilot if he had the weather information for EVW, and the pilot responded that he did.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot requested and was subsequently cleared for the ILS RWY 23 approach to EVW starting at the FBR VOR initial approach fix. The pilot was initially cleared to FBR at 15,000 ft mean sea level (msl) which the pilot acknowledged. However, while proceeding to FBR, the controller issued several low altitude alerts which the pilot initially did not respond to with the airplane having descended down to 14,400 ft msl. The pilot responded that he was bouncing around and the autopilot was trying to maintain 15,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLater, the airplane was cleared to cross FBR at or above 10,000 ft msl, and then cleared for the ILS 23 approach. At 1459, the airplane crossed the final approach fix and descended for the approach. At 1502:07, the airplane was at 7,300 ft msl, just below the approach's decision height of 7,343 ft, and about 1.6 nautical miles from the runway threshold. The airplane then climbed past 7,700 ft msl and entered a left, 270° turn, during which the airplane climbed and descended. The airplane then entered a right turn before radar contact was lost at an altitude of 7,900 ft msl. The published missed approach procedure included a straight-ahead climb to 7,600 ft, then a climbing, slight left turn toward a designated holding point about 17 nautical miles southwest of EVW.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral residents heard the airplane and the sound of the impact and called emergency responders, who dispatched to the accident site. A postimpact fire consumed large portions of the fuselage and wings. - An autopsy on the pilot by an independent pathologist revealed mild-to-moderate coronary artery disease with no blood clots and no evidence of a recent or remote heart attack. The pulmonary circulation was unremarkable, but the cerebral circulation was not available for examination. Multiple gallstones were present, but there was no reported obstruction or inflammation. The cause of death was listed as multiple traumatic and thermal injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on specimens from the pilot. Results were negative for all tested for substances. - A weather study was conducted by an National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) meteorologist. At 0432 on the morning of the accident, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a Winter Storm Warning for Uinta County, which included Evanston, Wyoming, and warned heavy snow was likely to start at 0900, with total snow accumulation of 8 to 14 inches. At 1227, the NWS Storm Prediction Center identified an area of potential convective activity that encompassed the Evanston area. At 1400, an NWS Surface Analysis Chart recorded a cold frontal boundary extending from just south of the accident site through Utah and into Nevada.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1420, before the pilot initiated the approach, the conditions reported by the automated surface observing system (ASOS) at EVW included wind from 290° at 17 knots, 2 miles visibility, light snow and mist, broken clouds at 2,400 ft above ground level (agl), overcast clouds at 3,600 ft agl, temperature 0°C, dew point -2°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.47 inches of mercury. Peak wind was observed from 260° at 32 knots at 1401.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout the time the airplane passed the intermediate fix on the approach, the ASOS reported 3/4-mile visibility with light snow and mist and a broken ceiling at 700 ft agl. Twelve minutes later, and prior to the airplane crossing the final approach fix, the ASOS reported 1/4-mile visibility with snow, freezing fog, and a vertical visibility of 800 ft. Of note, the minimum weather needed to fly the ILS RWY 23 approach is 200 ft and 1/2-mile visibility for all category of aircraft. About the time the airplane began the missed approach, the ASOS reported wind from 350° at 14 knots, 1/2 mile visibility in snow and freezing fog and a vertical visibility of 800 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the 1- and 5-minute interval recording of ASOS data indicated IFR to low instrument flight rules (LIFR) conditions, gusty surface winds, light to heavy snow, and ceilings between 700 to 1,400 ft agl at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model sounding indicated the possibility of low-level wind shear from the surface to 9,500 ft msl and clear air turbulence above 8,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of official weather briefing sources (such as Leidos Flight Service and Direct User Access Terminal Service) revealed that the pilot did not request a weather briefing from those sources. However, a search of archived ForeFlight information indicated that the accident pilot  received a weather briefing package from ForeFlight at 1934 the day before the accident, prior to the release of the significant weather. Most of the information related to the winter storm was issued on the morning of the accident. Foreflight is still able to obtain weather through various means while in flight; however, no record is maintaining of the information accessed. Of note, the pilot changed his destination several times inflight citing weather information. It is not known how the pilot was obtaining those weather updates.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional weather information is located in the docket of this report. - According to airplane maintenance log entries and logged instrument flight plans, the pilot had at least 90 hours in the airplane make and model. - The first impact point was identified in several trees. The right wingtip was found near one of the trees. The angle of impact was estimated at 60° nose low on a magnetic heading of 358°. The ground impact point was identified by a small divot followed by the engine. The main wreckage comprised the fuselage, empennage, and left wing. A post-impact fire consumed most of the cockpit and forward fuselage. The right wing was displaced from the fuselage and came to rest on the right side of the debris area. All major components of the airplane were located at the accident site. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit controls to all primary flight control surfaces. Flap jackscrew positions were consistent with a flaps setting of 34°, which was consistent with a landing configuration. Landing gear actuator positions indicated that the landing gear were retracted. The avionics and cockpit switches were impact damaged and either partially or totally consumed by the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed and examined. Fire and impact damage precluded functional testing of the major components; however, disassembly revealed circumferential rubbing and smearing of fan discs in multiple stages of the engine, including the compressor and turbine section, consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact. No preimpact anomalies of the engine were found. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot was conducting an instrument flight rules business flight to an uncontrolled airport with forecast and reported moderate icing conditions. The pilot reported that he activated the deice systems and then executed an instrument landing system approach to the airport with the autopilot connected. While descending through about 1,200 ft above ground level, the pilot extended the landing gear and lowered the flaps to the takeoff setting and subsequently noticed the airplane shudder. Flight data from the airplane's avionics display revealed that the pilot continued the approach, and while on short final, he retarded the throttle toward idle and then disconnected the autopilot. While approaching the runway threshold, the pilot allowed the airspeed to decrease below the Pilot's Operating Handbook's (POH) minimum-recommended approach speed for icing conditions. The airplane's descent rate then increased, and the airplane banked left. The pilot subsequently applied full throttle, and the airplane impacted the ground 1,463 ft short of the runway threshold, skidded 460 ft, hit a hole, and nosed over. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the accident site, significant ice accumulation was noted on both of the wings and the stabilizer, including ice buildup aft of the deice boots. Weather data indicated that the flight encountered areas of freezing drizzle and supercooled liquid water. Given this evidence, the airplane likely encountered severe (rather than the forecast moderate) in-flight icing conditions during the approach that exceeded the airplane's anti-ice systems' capabilities and led to the pilot's loss of airplane control. Given the icing conditions, the pilot should have maintained the POH's minimum-recommended approach speed for icing conditions.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The pilot operating handbook (POH) contains the following information and guidance for the aircraft, which was certified for flight into known icing conditions:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen ice has accumulated on the unprotected surfaces of the airplane, aerodynamic characteristics may be changed. Particularly, stall speeds may increase by up to 15 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 'Flaps-Takeoff' and up to 10 KIAS at 'Flaps-Landing'.  For flight into known icing conditions, minimum recommended speed (for the airplane's weight at the time of the accident) is 110 KIAS at 'Flaps-Takeoff' and 90 KIAS at 'Flaps-Landing'.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSevere icing may result from environmental conditions outside of those for which the airplane if certificated. Flight in freezing rain, freezing drizzle, or mixed icing conditions (supercooled liquid water and ice crystals) may result in ice build-up on protected surfaces exceeding the capability of the ice protection system, or may result in ice forming aft of the protected surfaces. This ice may not be shed using the ice protection systems, and may seriously degrade the performance and controllability of the airplane. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 91-47B, 'Pilot Guide: Flight in Icing Conditions,' contains the following guidance for approach and landing in icing conditions:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetermine if freezing drizzle or freezing rain are being reported and avoid flying into these areas. A ground observation of any type of precipitation when temperatures are near freezing may indicate freezing precipitation aloft, so be vigilant for severe icing conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn accordance with the POH, use a higher approach speed into the landing when carrying an accumulation of ice. Carry some power on flare and flare slightly faster than normal if carrying ice.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Piper PA-46, operating northeast of Wichita during the timeframe of this accident, also encountered significant icing conditions and made an emergency off field landing. This PA-46 was also certified for flight into known icing conditions, but the pilot was unable to maintain altitude and encountered a stall buffet that required him to make a forced landing. The NTSB case number for this accident is GAA16CA107. - The AAO airport lists an elevation of 1,421 ft, with a single runway 18/36 at 6,101 ft long by 100 ft wide. The airport does not have an air traffic control tower. The airport had a federally installed and maintained Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS). - On January 19, 2016, about 1231 central standard time, a Socata TBM 700 airplane, N602MA, was substantially damaged after landing short at the Colonel James Jabara Airport (AAO), Wichita, Kansas. The private pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Premier Furnace Specialists, Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a business flight. Day instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed for the flight, which departed on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan from the Schenck Field Airport (ICL), Clarinda, Iowa, about 1137.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated after his departure from ICL, he was in and out clouds at his cruising altitude of flight level 200. He was advised of icing conditions along the route of flight and activated the de-ice boots to automatic, turned on the propeller heat, and the heated windshield, each of which appeared to be operating normally. On his descent into AAO, the pilot observed ice accumulating on the leading edges of the wings, but the de-ice boots appeared to be operating to keep the leading edges of the wings clear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot flew an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 18 at AAO with the autopilot connected. After exiting IMC conditions on final about 1,200 ft agl, the pilot stated that he lowered flaps to the takeoff setting and extended the landing gear. Descending through about 1,000 ft agl, he noticed the airplane shudder, with an immediate increase in sink rate. The pilot stated he applied full engine power while on final, but the airplane continued to sink and subsequently touched down 1,463 ft short of the Runway 18 threshold. The airplane skidded 460 ft, during which the landing gear impacted a ground hog hole and the airplane nosed over, which damaged the firewall and wing spar.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel responded to the accident site about 1500 and noted approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch of ice on both wings. The ice accumulation was aft of the deice boot and continued aft to the trailing edge of each wing. The vertical stabilizer had similar amounts of ice buildup, which included ice accumulation aft of the stabilizer de-ice boot. - At 1239, the weather observation station at AAO reported the following conditions:  wind 050 degrees at 8 knots, visibility 2 ½ miles in mist, broken clouds at 700 ft agl, overcast clouds at 1,100 ft agl, temperature minus 2 degrees C, dew point minus 3 degrees C, and altimeter setting 30.13 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1233, the weather observation station at Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport (ICT), Wichita, Kansas, located about 12 miles southwest of AAO, reported the following conditions: wind 020 degrees at 7 knots, visibility 2 miles in light drizzle and mist, overcast clouds at 800 ft agl, temperature minus 1 degrees C, dew point minus 3 degrees C, altimeter setting 30.13 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) for ICT issued at 0854 and used by the pilot for preflight planning expected minimum visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions at the estimated time of arrival with wind 110 degrees at 12 knots, visibility unrestricted, and overcast clouds at 1,500 ft agl. Light freezing drizzle was forecast between 1300 and 1900.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the National Weather Service had an Airmen's Meteorological Advisory (AIRMET) covering the route for moderate icing conditions from the freezing level to 18,000 ft msl.  The freezing level was identified from the surface to 7,000 ft msl across the region.  A review of the forecast icing products from 4 hours prior to the accident also indicated a high probability of encountering icing conditions over the route and the Wichita, Kansas area, with moderate intensity, and with some potential of supercooled large drop (SLD) conditions over the region.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the period surrounding the accident there were 14 pilot reports of icing along the route ranging from a trace to moderate intensity, with light intensity the most frequent (10 reports). The type of ice varied from rime type ice (5 reports), clear (4 reports), and mixed type icing (3 reports). No severe icing events were reported in the system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe official observations disseminated from  the ASOS at AAO noted a rapid decrease in visibility between 1154 and 1239, with visibility decreasing from 8 miles down to 2 ½ miles in mist.  The ASOS system did not detect any measureable precipitation during this period.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCurrent ASOS systems utilize a Light Emitting Diode Weather Identifier (LEDWI) optical sensor to report precipitation falling through the sensor volume to determine rain or snow. The sensor is unable to detect very light precipitation at less than 0.01 inch per hour, which often occurs with mist or freezing drizzle. Currently, ASOS systems do not report freezing drizzle. - On January 28, 2016, the FAA and aircraft manufacturer personnel performed an examination and operational test of the aircraft de-ice systems. The de-ice boots, pitot/stall vanes, and windshield de-ice systems all performed normally. No anomalies were noted with the de-ice systems. The flaps were observed to be near the 'takeoff' position.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 system. Downloaded flight data revealed the following information from the last 20 seconds of the flight:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1230:59 to 1231:11 – Airspeed decreased from 102 KIAS to 92 KIAS and engine torque decreased from 20% to 8%.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1231:11 - Autopilot was disconnected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1231:14 – Airspeed decreased to 89 KIAS, descent rate increased, and the airplane banked 10 degrees to the left.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1231:16 – Engine torque increased to 110% (all engine data showed a normal engine response for increased throttle input) and the airplane banked 24 degrees to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1231:19 – Approximate time of ground impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airline transport pilot was landing at the destination airport after a cross-country flight in visual meteorological conditions. The tower controller stated that the airplane's landing gear appeared to be extended during final approach and that the airplane landed within the runway's touchdown zone. The tower controller stated that, although the airplane made a normal landing, he heard a squealing noise that continued longer than what he believed was typical. The pilot subsequently transmitted \"go-around.\" The tower controller acknowledged the go-around and cleared the pilot to enter a left traffic pattern. The tower controller stated that he heard the engine speed accelerate while the airplane maintained a level attitude over the runway until it passed midfield. He then saw the airplane pitch up and enter a climbing left turn. The tower controller stated that the airplane appeared to enter an aerodynamic stall before it descended into terrain in a left-wing-down attitude. Another witness reported that he saw the airplane, with its landing gear extended, in a steep left turn before it descended rapidly into terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination did not reveal any evidence of flight control, landing gear, or engine malfunction. An examination of the runway revealed numerous propeller slash marks that began about 215 ft past the runway's touchdown zone; however, there was no evidence that any portion of the airframe had impacted the runway during the landing. Additionally, measurement of the landing gear actuators confirmed that all three landing gear were fully extended at the accident site. Therefore, the pilot likely did not adequately control the airplane's pitch during the landing, which allowed the propeller to contact the runway. Due to the propeller strikes, the propeller was likely damaged and unable to provide adequate thrust during the go-around. Further, based on the witness accounts, the pilot likely did not maintain adequate airspeed during the climbing left turn, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Safety Alert No. SA-019, Prevent Aerodynamic Stalls at Low Altitude, many aerodynamic stalls occur in visual meteorological conditions when a pilot becomes momentarily distracted from the primary task of flying, such as while maneuvering in the airport traffic pattern, during an emergency, or when fixating on ground objects. The safety alert further states that reducing angle-of-attack by lowering the airplane's nose at the first indication of a stall is the most important immediate response for stall avoidance and stall recovery. - The airplane was a 2009 Socata TBM 700, serial number 518. The low-wing airplane was of conventional aluminum construction and was equipped with a retractable tricycle landing gear and a pressurized cabin that was configured to seat six individuals. The airplane was powered by an 850 shaft-horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D turbo-propeller engine, serial number PCE-RV0179, through a 4-blade, constant speed, full-feathering, Hartzell model HC-E4N-3/E9083SK propeller assembly. The airplane was approved for operations in instrument meteorological conditions and in known icing conditions. The airplane had a maximum allowable takeoff weight of 7,394 pounds. On December 2, 2009, the airplane was issued a standard airworthiness certificate and a registration number when it was imported into the United States after manufacture in France. The current airplane owner, Trustey Management Corporation, purchased the airplane on December 16, 2009.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to maintenance records, the airplane had been maintained under the provisions of an approved manufacturer inspection program. The most recent phase inspection was completed on December 29, 2014, at 656.7 hours total airframe time. The recording hour meter was destroyed during the postimpact fire, which precluded a determination of the airplane's total service time at the time of the accident. A postaccident review of the available maintenance records found no history of unresolved airworthiness issues.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had two fuel tanks, one located in each wing, and a total fuel capacity of 301 gallons (292 gallons usable). According to available fueling information, the fuel tanks were topped-off before the accident flight. - Lawrence J. Timmerman Airport (MWC), a public airport located about 5 miles northwest of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was owned and operated by Milwaukee County. The airport field elevation was 745 ft msl. The airport was served by two asphalt runways, runway 15L/33R (4,103 ft by 75 ft) and runway 4L/22R (3,201 ft by 75 ft). Runway 4L/22R was closed for maintenance at the time of the accident. The airport also had two turf runways, runway 15R/33L (3,231 ft by 270 ft) and runway 4R/22L (2,839 ft by 270 ft). The airport was equipped with an air traffic control tower that was operational at the time of the accident. - A review of available air traffic control information indicated that the accident flight received normal services and handling. Transcripts of the voice communications recorded between the accident pilot and the tower controller are included in the docket materials associated with the investigation. - On July 29, 2015, about 1810 central daylight time, a Socata TBM 700 single-engine turboprop airplane, N425KJ, collided with terrain following a loss of control during a go-around at Lawrence J. Timmerman Airport (MWC), Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The airline transport pilot and his passenger were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to Trustey Management Corporation and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Beverly Municipal Airport (BVY), Beverly, Massachusetts, at 1552 eastern daylight time with a destination of MWC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) data, the flight was cleared for a visual approach to runway 33R at MWC. At 1808:12, while on a 2.5-mile final approach, the pilot asked the tower controller for the current wind conditions. At 1808:18, the tower controller told the pilot that the prevailing wind was from 230° at 10 knots. At 1808:21, the pilot replied, \"Three zero one zero, thanks, or two three zero?\" At 1808:24, the tower controller responded, \"Two three, two thirty.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a postaccident interview, the tower controller reported that he established visual contact with the airplane when it was on a 3-mile final approach to runway 33R. The tower controller stated that the airplane's landing gear appeared to be extended during final approach and that the airplane landed within the runway's touchdown zone. The tower controller further stated that, although the airplane made a normal landing, he heard a squealing noise that continued longer than what he believed was typical.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to ATC transmissions, at 1809:56, shortly after the airplane had touched down, the pilot transmitted, \"go-around.\" The tower controller acknowledged the go-around and cleared the pilot to enter a left traffic pattern. The tower controller stated that he heard the engine speed accelerate while the airplane maintained a level attitude over the runway until it passed midfield. He then saw the airplane pitch up and enter a climbing left turn. The tower controller stated that the airplane appeared to \"stall\" during the turn before it descended into terrain in a left-wing-down attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness reported that he saw the airplane, with its landing gear extended, in a steep left turn before it descended toward the ground. He stated that the airplane maintained the steep left bank throughout the final descent and estimated that the airplane's final descent path was about 45° below a level flight attitude. The witness reported that, shortly after he lost sight of the airplane, he heard it impact terrain and saw a large explosion. - The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was attributed to thermal injuries and the inhalation of combustion products during the postaccident fire. The autopsy report also noted multiple blunt-force injuries. The FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on specimens obtained during the autopsy. The test results included 23% carbon monoxide and 1.3 ug/ml cyanide detected in blood. There was no ethanol detected in vitreous. Ibuprofen was detected in urine. Ibuprofen, sold under multiple brand names, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic drug. - At 1745, the MWC automated surface observing system reported: wind 270° at 14 knots, a clear sky, 10 miles surface visibility; temperature 29°C; dew point 6°C; and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to air traffic control communications, at 1808:12, the pilot asked the tower controller for the current wind conditions while on final approach to runway 33R. The tower controller replied that the prevailing wind was from 230° at 10 knots. - According to FAA records, the 53-year-old pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with single-engine land, multi-engine land, and instrument airplane ratings. The airplane single-engine land rating was limited to commercial privileges. The pilot was type-rated for the Bombardier Challenger 300 and Embraer Phenom 300. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on June 13, 2014, with no restrictions or limitations. On the application for his current medical certificate, the pilot reported having accumulated 1,594 total hours of flight experience, of which 112 hours were flown within the previous 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's flight history was established using his logbook. The final logbook entry was dated July 20, 2015, at which time he had accumulated 1,875.1 hours total flight time. The pilot had logged 1,656.5 hours as pilot-in-command, 1,363 hours in single-engine airplanes, and 512.1 hours in multi-engine airplanes. He had flown 268.1 hours during the year before the accident, 152.7 hours during the 6 months before the accident, 64.4 hours during the 90 days before the accident, and 16.2 hours during the month before the accident. Based on available information, the 3.3-hour accident flight was the only flight flown within 24 hours of the accident. The pilot had accumulated 721.1 hours in the accident airplane make/model. His last flight review and instrument proficiency check were completed in the accident airplane on November 16, 2014. - A postaccident examination of runway 33R revealed numerous slash marks consistent with propeller blades striking the asphalt runway surface. The first propeller strike was identified about 1,384 ft from the runway 33R threshold, or about 215 ft past the runway's touchdown zone. There were 22 propeller strike marks identified over a distance of about 25 feet 7 inches. The propeller strike marks were located slightly right of the runway centerline. There were also numerous small asphalt pieces found adjacent to the slash markings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage was in an open field located on the west side of the airport property. The initial impact was identified by a small ground depression that contained pieces of red lens material that were consistent with the left wing navigational light. A large area of burnt ground and vegetation preceded the main wreckage. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 180° heading and measured about 141 ft. The propeller, nose landing gear, right flap, and left aileron were located along the wreckage debris path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the fuselage, empennage, both wings, and the engine. The main wreckage was oriented on a north heading. A majority of the fuselage, including the cockpit, cabin, and the left wing were consumed by the postimpact fire. The cockpit Garmin G1000 avionic components, including the nonvolatile memory cards, were destroyed by the postimpact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established due to impact and fire damage; however, all observed separations were consistent with overstress or were consumed during the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear selector switch was found in the \"DOWN\" position. Measurements of the landing gear actuators were consistent with all three landing gear being fully extended at the time of impact. Examination of the nose wheel tire and right main tire did not reveal any flat spots. The right main and nose wheel assemblies rotated freely, and no anomalies were noted with the right brake components. A majority of the left main tire was consumed during the postimpact fire. The fuselage skid plates, installed on the lower wing spar carry-through structure, did not exhibit any evidence of being scraped. The lower VHF antenna had separated from the fuselage and was located along the wreckage debris path. The lower VHF antenna did not exhibit any evidence of being scraped. The trailing edge of the right flap and the corresponding flap track fairings did not exhibit any evidence of being scraped. The left flap was partially consumed during the postimpact fire. Measurements of the flap actuator jack screws established that the flaps were extended to 34°, which was consistent with a normal landing flap configuration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller assembly and the forward section of the reduction gearbox had separated from the engine and were found along the wreckage debris path. All four propeller blades remained attached to the hub assembly and exhibited S-shaped bends, tip curls, chordwise scratching, and leading edge damage. The fractured propeller shaft exhibited features consistent with torsional overload. The engine exhaust exhibited evidence of torsional bending associated with impact. The downstream face of the compressor turbine disc and blades exhibited rotational scoring from contact with the adjacent static components. The upstream face of the compressor turbine disc and blades were unremarkable. The first-stage power turbine vane and baffle exhibited rub marks on both sides from contact with the power turbine and compressor turbine discs and blades. The first-stage power turbine disc and blades exhibited rotational scoring on the upstream face. Examination of the engine oil filter and magnetic chip detectors did not reveal any significant particulate contamination. The observed damage to the propeller and engine components were consistent with the engine operating at a medium to high power output at the time of final impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor and commercial pilot were conducting a local instructional flight as part of an insurance requirement. The flight instructor stated that, after performing pattern work, the pilot performed two landings and that, while performing the approach for a third landing with 0 degree of flaps, the landing gear were not extended at midfield. He stated that this had also happened on the previous two landings. He added that, as the airplane descended into ground effect, he and the pilot realized that the landing gear were not down and \"took immediate steps to go around\"; however, the airplane contacted the runway surface with the gear up. The pilot stated that he was \"distracted\" by watching the airplane's airspeed and attitude and that, during touchdown, he heard the airplane contact the runway and that he then applied power to initiate an aborted landing because \"there was not much runway left.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven that the flight instructor had noted that the pilot had not extended the landing gear by midfield on the previous two landings, he should have had a heightened focus on the gear's position during the subsequent/accident landing. Further, the Before Landing checklist stated to extend the landing gear and verify that the landing gear position indicator lights were green. If the pilot had followed the Before Landing checklist or if the flight instructor had been adequately supervising the pilot, the landing gear likely would have been extended upon landing.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On April 14, 2015, about 1145 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N850WM, experienced a gear-up landing on runway 24 (3,804 feet by 75 feet, asphalt) at Evart Municipal Airport (9C8), Evart, Michigan. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the bottom fuselage skin. The commercial pilot and flight instructor were uninjured. The airplane was registered to Wings Up III LLC and operated by the pilot. The instructional flight was operated under Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an instructional flight, which was not operating on a flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local flight last departed from 9C8 about 1100 and was planned to return to 9C8 but diverted to Roben-Hood Airport (RQB), Big Rapids, Michigan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane accident was not reported by the owner/operator but was discovered by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector from the Grand Rapids Flight Standards District Office after being notified of the accident by a person on April 28, 2015. The airplane had been moved to Socata North America, Inc., Pompano, Florida where it was going to undergo repair as instructed by the insurance representatives for Traverse City Helicopters, LLC. On May 6, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration reported the accident to the National Transportation Safety Board Central Region Duty Officer. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor stated that they departed from 9C8 with a normal take-off from runway 24 followed by \"basic\" visual flight rules air work that included steep turns and slow flight. They returned to 9C8 for pattern work where a normal landing was performed followed by a landing using 10 degrees of flaps and a landing with 0 degrees of flaps. While performing the approach/landing with 0 degrees of flaps, the landing gear was not extended at midfield, as had happened on the previous two landings. As the airplane descended into ground effect, the pilot and the flight instructor realized that the landing gear was not down and \"took immediate steps to go around.\" The rear ventral strikes and a portion of the aft belly contacted the runway before descent could be reversed, and the propeller struck the runway. They continued the climb out, assessed the damage and controllability, and then diverted to RQB where a maintenance facility could look at the airplane. The flight landed at RQB without further incident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a telephone conversation with the pilot, the pilot said he was a \"long time fixed wing pilot.\" He said that the instructional flight was part of an airplane checkout required by the insurance company, and the flight instructor was recommended by the insurance company. The pilot stated that he went through \"a lot of ground stuff\" as part of his training in the accident airplane, and the accident flight was the first flight flown with the flight instructor. The pilot stated that prior to the accident he did not know that there was no gear warning annunciation without the flaps extended. The pilot said that he was the flying pilot at the time of the accident, and the flight instructor was demonstrating a no flap approach. The pilot said they prior they were flying a \"quite large\" traffic pattern. The pilot said that he was \"distracted\" from watching the airspeed and attitude of the airplane and during touchdown he heard the noise of the airplane contact with the runway and applied power to initiate an aborted landing because \"there was not much runway left.\" Once airborne, they got the airplane stable and decided to continue the flight to an airport that had more aircraft services available. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the TBM 700 Pilot Operating Handbook, Section 4, Normal Procedures, Before Landing checklist, the landing gear control was to be in the down position, the three landing gear green lights were to be on, and the red warning light was to be off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's logbook showed that he did not have a high altitude endorsement under Part 61.31(g) \"Additional training required for operating pressurized aircraft capable of operating at high altitudes.\" The pilot's logbook showed that he accumulated a total of 19.7 hours of dual instruction received in the Socata TBM 700, and accumulated no pilot-in-command flight time in the Socata TBM 700. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight. The pilot reported that, during cruise flight at 6,000 ft mean sea level, he observed a crew alerting system oil pressure message, followed by a total loss of engine power. An air traffic controller provided vectors to a local airport; however, the pilot reported that the airplane would not reach the runway. He did not attempt to restart the engine. He feathered the propeller and placed the power lever to \"idle\" and the condition lever to \"cut off.\" The pilot subsequently attempted a forced landing to a sports field with the gear and flaps retracted. The airplane collided with trees and the ground and then came to rest upright.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that it displayed contact signatures to its internal components and evidence of ingested unburned organic debris, consistent with the engine likely being unpowered and the engine gas generator and power sections wind-milling at the time of impact. No evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies or malfunctions to any of the engine components was found that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded GPS flight track and systems data showed that the loss of engine power was preceded by about 5 minutes of flight on a constant heading and altitude with an excessive lateral g force of about 0.17 g and a bank angle between about 8 and 10 degrees, consistent with a side-slip flight condition. The airplane then entered a right turn with the autopilot engaged, and it lost power at the end of the turn. The data indicated that, even though the autopilot was engaged, the lateral g forces increased as the airplane leveled off and accelerated, indicating that the automatic rudder trim feature of the yaw damper system was not engaged. Given that the yaw damper system operated normally after the flight, it is likely that the pilot inadvertently and unknowingly disengaged the yaw damper during flight with the autopilot engaged. During a postaccident interview, the pilot stated that he was not aware of a side-slip condition before the loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the fuel tank system was designed to prevent unporting of the fuel lines during momentary periods of uncoordinated flight, it was not intended to do so for extended periods of uncoordinated flight. Therefore, the fuel tank feed line likely unported during the prolonged uncoordinated flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of engine power. If the pilot had recognized the side-slip condition, he could have returned to coordinated flight and prevented the engine power loss. Also, once the airplane returned to coordinated flight, an engine restart would have been possible.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Fuel Tank Design&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had integral fuel tanks formed by sealing of the structure in each wing. Each tank was divided into an inboard (feeder) area and an outboard (storage) area. The feeder section of each fuel tank was formed by the root rib and the second rib outboard from the root. This rib contained one-way valves that would allow fuel to flow from the outboard storage area into the inboard feeder area, but prevented fuel from flowing outboard. The fuel capacity of the feeder section of the tank was about 33 liters or about 8.7 gallons. The one way valves in the feeder section were intended to prevent unporting of the fuel tank pickup due to momentary periods of uncoordinated flight as would be encountered during turbulence, but were not intended to do so for extended periods of uncoordinated flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopilot and Yaw Damper Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with an automatic flight control system (AFCS) that included an autopilot and yaw damper. The autopilot controlled the aircraft pitch and roll attitudes following commands received from the flight director. The yaw damper system operated independent of autopilot and was designed to monitor lateral acceleration to achieve coordinated flight. The system was also designed to automatically actuate the rudder trim to achieve trimmed flight. The automatic trim feature was only enabled when the yaw damper system was engaged. The rudder trim system also included a manual electric yaw trim (MEYT) switch on the pilot yoke that enabled the pilot to trim the rudder without yaw damper engagement. The yaw damper system could be enabled independent of the autopilot by depressing the \"YD\" button. In addition, if the pilot selected the \"AP\" key, the autopilot, yaw damper and flight director would be activated simultaneously. The yaw damper system could be disengaged by activating the MEYT switch located on the yoke, or by depressing the \"YD\" button. The parameters recorded by the G1000 avionics system did not include a discrete parameter indicating yaw damper engagement or trim motor actuation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe G1000 indications of extended flight in a slip condition were indicative of the yaw damper being disconnected while the autopilot was engaged. Steady heading side slips occur with no trim action on the yaw axis as the aircraft increases speed and maintains a steady heading and altitude. Rudder trim was provided automatically with the yaw damper on, or manually using the rudder trim. During a post-accident interview with the pilot, he stated that he was not aware of a side-slip condition prior to the loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 8, 2014, TBM issued Service Information (SI) 2014-006, which provided an upgrade (version 14.02) to the G1000 version 14.01 software. Included in the upgrade was a new CAS caution message, \"AP ON YD OFF\" that illuminated when the autopilot was on while the yaw damper was off. This condition would include a scenario of inadvertent pilot deactivation of the yaw damper. An aural warning was also incorporated to direct the pilot to the CAS message. At the time of the accident, the accident airplane did not have the upgrade to version 14.02 installed. The owner reported that he planned to install it at the next annual inspection, due in January, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nChapter 3 of the TBM 850 Pilot's Operating Handbook addresses engine failure in flight. Step number 8 of the ENGINE FAILURE DURING FLIGHT checklist calls for an air start attempt and directs the pilot to the air start procedure (section 3.4). The pilot reported that he did not attempt an air start. - The accident airplane was a Socata model TBM 700 (850), serial number 536, manufactured in 2010. It was a single engine low-wing monoplane of mainly aluminum construction. It had a retractable tricycle landing gear and was configured to seat six occupants. The airplane was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D engine, serial number RV0159, rated to produce 850 shaft-horsepower. It was fitted with a Hartzell HC-E4N-3, four-bladed, constant speed propeller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of available maintenance records revealed that an annual inspection was completed on the airframe and engine on January 8, 2014. The airframe total time at the time of the accident was 719.8 hours. The time since the last annual inspection was 135.6 hours. - The airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 all-glass avionics suite. The unit held a Secure Digital (SD) card and investigators confirmed that the card recorded flight and systems data before and during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS track data, retrieved from the Garmin G1000 system, depicted the airplane departing PDK about 1240. About 18 seconds after takeoff, the autopilot was turned on. G1000 data indicated that during the climb portion of the flight, the lateral acceleration values were near neutral. This indicated that the rudder trim was appropriately set for the climb portion of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1244:52, the airplane reached 6,000 feet above mean sea level, leveled off, and began to accelerate. During the next 5 minutes, the airplane's lateral acceleration reached 0.17g while the airplane maintained a left bank of about 8-10 degrees while on a heading of about 190 degrees. These roll, lateral acceleration, and heading values indicated that the airplane was flying in a side-slip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1249:53, the airplane started a right turn with the autopilot engaged, to a heading of 240 degrees. At the end of the turn, at 1250:16, the engine lost power. A sudden drop of NG (gas producer speed), torque, and fuel flow was observed. At 1251, the pilot disconnected the autopilot and the airplane returned to near-coordinated flight until the airplane completed its descent to the forced landing. - On October 5, 2014, about 1255 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700 (850), N536EM, was force landed onto a high school sports field near Fayetteville, Georgia. The commercial pilot received minor injuries and one passenger, his wife, had serious injuries. The airplane was registered to TBM 850 536 LLC and was operated by pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Dekalb-Peachtree Airport (PDK), Atlanta, Georgia about 1240 and was destined for Pine Mountain, Georgia (PIM).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported the following. During cruise flight at 6,000 feet above mean sea level (msl), he observed an oil pressure message on the crew alerting system (CAS) and a total loss of engine power. The air traffic controller provided vectors to Falcon Field, Peachtree City, Georgia (FFC), and later the pilot reported that he would not make the runway. An engine restart was not attempted. He feathered the propeller, placed the power lever in idle, and the condition lever to cut off. The landing gear and flaps remained in the retracted positions. Radar contact was subsequently lost and the pilot force landed the airplane. The airplane collided with trees and the ground before coming to rest upright. There was no fire. The pilot and his wife exited the airplane and were transported to a local hospital for treatment. - The 1253 surface weather observation for FFC, located about 3 nautical miles west-northwest of the accident site, included sky clear, wind calm, visibility 10 statute miles or greater, temperature 64 degrees F, dew point 36 degrees F, and altimeter setting 30.06 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 66, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine land and instrument airplane. He reported a total flight experience of 4,244 hours, including 411 hours in the accident airplane make and model. He possessed a class 3 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed a TBM 850 recurrent training course at SIMCOM, Orlando, Florida on January 24, 2014. - Fuel System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aircraft fuel system was examined after recovery of the wreckage to a storage facility. The cockpit fuel selector was in the LEFT tank position and the fuel selector valve indicated that fuel was feeding from the left tank. Both inboard wing fuel doors were opened to inspect the pickup area; no anomalies were found. The fuel screen, low fuel sensor, and flapper valves all appeared normal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel lines from the left tank to the engine were examined for obstructions with forced air; none were found. The fuel filter was removed and examined; no contamination was found. The fuel selector valve operated in a normal manner.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed and sent to the manufacturer's facility for disassembly and examination. The engine displayed moderate impact damage including structural separation of the forward reduction gearbox, impact fracture of the propeller shaft, and light compressional deformation of the exhaust duct.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator rotor and accessory gearbox turned freely by hand. Light circumferential rubbing was displayed by the compressor turbine shroud due to contact with the adjacent blade tips. Unburned organic debris was distributed in the combustion section. The power section was seized due to the deformation of the exhaust duct. Circumferential rubbing was displayed by the first and second stage power turbine shrouds due to contact with their adjacent blade tips. None of the engine mechanical components displayed any indications of any pre-impact anomalies or distress.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigation of the engine controls and accessories included functional testing of the fuel pump, fuel control unit, flow divider, fuel nozzles, and torque limiter. The propeller governor was disassembled and inspected as impact damage precluded functional testing. None of the components showed any conditions that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRudder Trim System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe electrical rudder trim actuator was found positioned slightly left of neutral. Electrical power was applied to the rudder trim and yaw damper systems after the accident and both operated in a normal manner. - An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The wreckage came to rest, upright, on level ground at a high school sports complex. The fuselage and both wings exhibited structural damage and both wing fuel tanks were ruptured from impact forces. The landing gear and wing flaps were found in the retracted positions. There was evidence of fuel spillage throughout the wreckage path. The propeller and gearbox were broken free from the engine. The engine remained attached to the firewall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major airframe structural and flight control components were accounted for within the wreckage debris field. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit controls to the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. The fuel tank selector handle was found in the \"L\" (left) tank position. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "About 3 months before the accident, the pilot received about 9 hours of flight instruction, including completion of an instrument proficiency check, in the airplane. The accident flight was a personal cross-country flight operated under instrument flight rules (IFR). Radar track data depicted the flight proceeding on a west-southwest course at 15,800 ft mean sea level (msl) as it approached the destination airport. The flight was cleared by the air traffic controller for a GPS approach, passed the initial approach fix, and, shortly afterward, began a descent as permitted by the approach procedure. The track data indicated that the flight became established on the initial approach segment and remained above the designated minimum altitude of 12,000 ft msl. Average descent rates based on the available altitude data ranged from 500 feet per minute (fpm) to 1,000 fpm during this portion of the flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the intermediate navigation fix, the approach procedure required pilots to turn right and track a north-northwest course toward the airport. The track data indicated that the flight entered a right turn about 1 mile before reaching the intermediate fix. As the airplane entered the right turn, its average descent rate reached 4,000 fpm. The flight subsequently tracked northbound for nearly 1-1/2 miles. During this portion of the flight, the airplane initially descended at an average rate of 3,500 fpm then climbed at a rate of 1,800 fpm. The airplane subsequently entered a second right turn. The final three radar data points were each located within 505 ft laterally of each other and near the approximate accident site location. The average descent rate between the final two data points (altitudes of 10,100 ft msl and 8,700 ft msl) was 7,000 fpm. About the time that the final data point was recorded, the pilot informed the air traffic controller that the airplane was in a spin and that he was attempting to recover. No further communications were received from the pilot. The airplane subsequently impacted the surface of a reservoir at an elevation of about 6,780 ft and came to rest in 60 ft of water. A detailed postaccident examination of the airframe, engine and propeller assembly did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe available meteorological data suggested that the airplane encountered clouds (tops about 16,000 ft msl or higher and bases about 10,000 ft msl) and was likely operating in IFR conditions during the final 15 minutes of the flight; however, no determination could be made regarding whether the clouds that the airplane descended through were solid or layered. In addition, the data suggested the possibility of both light icing and light turbulence between 12,000 ft msl and 16,000 ft msl along the flight path. Although the pilot appeared to be managing the flight appropriately during the initial descent, it could not be determined why he was unable to navigate to the approach fixes and maintain control of the airplane as he turned toward the airport and continued the descent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn March 22, 2014, at 1400 mountain daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N702H, impacted the Ridgway Reservoir, Ridgway, Colorado. The airplane came to rest in about 60 feet of water. The pilot and four passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to Gadsden Aviation LLC and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport. The flight was operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight originated from the Bartlesville Municipal Airport (BVO), Bartlesville, Oklahoma, about 1111. The intended destination was the Montrose Regional Airport (MTJ), Montrose, Colorado.At 0622 on the morning of the accident, the pilot accessed the Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) and obtained a weather briefing for the route of flight from the Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD), Gadsden, Alabama, to BVO.  An IFR flight plan for that route of flight was subsequently filed.  The accident pilot was listed as the pilot-in-command.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTracking data indicated that the airplane subsequently departed GAD about 0739 and arrived at BVO about 1001.  Personnel at the fixed base operator (FBO) located at BVO reported that upon arrival, the pilot requested that the airplane be topped off with fuel and that a ground power unit be made available for engine start.  They noted that the pilot and passengers came into the FBO to eat lunch.  At 1038, the pilot again accessed DUATS and obtained a weather briefing for the route of flight from BVO to MTJ.  An IFR flight plan was subsequently filed for that route of flight.  That flight plan also listed the accident pilot as the pilot-in-command.  The FBO personnel stated that the pilot and passengers re-boarded the airplane after their lunch.  The subsequent engine start up, taxi and takeoff appeared normal.  Nothing with respect to the airplane or the pilot seemed out of the ordinary, nor did they have any concerns regarding the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1111, the pilot contacted the Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and informed the controller that the flight had departed BVO and requested an IFR clearance to MTJ.  The accident flight was subsequently radar identified and cleared direct to MTJ at an ultimate cruising altitude of 26,000 feet pressure altitude (FL260).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1233, control of the flight was transferred to the Denver ARTCC.  At 1330, the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV(GPS) Rwy 35 approach at MTJ.  At 1341, the controller instructed the pilot to descend to and maintain 17,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  This was amended to 16,000 feet msl four minutes later.  At 1348, the pilot was instructed to maintain 16,000 feet msl until reaching the YARUB navigation fix, an initial approach fix for the MTJ RNAV (GPS) Rwy 35 approach procedure.  The pilot was also cleared for the approach at that time.  At 1358, the pilot was released to change to the airport advisory frequency.  At 1400:34 (hhmm:ss), the pilot transmitted, \"spin I'm trying to get out of here.\"  No further communications were received from the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) radar track data depicted the airplane proceeding on a west course at 15,800 feet as it approached MTJ.  The airplane passed the YARUB initial approach fix about 1356:59. About 23 seconds later, the airplane began a descent. The track data indicated that the airplane became established on the initial approach segment between YARUB and COQKU. The minimum altitude for this approach segment was 12,000 feet msl. At COQKU, the approach procedure required pilots to turn right and track a magnetic course of 328 degrees. The minimum altitude for that approach segment was 9,900 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1358:58, the airplane was located about 1.7 nm east-northeast of COQKU at an altitude of 14,400 feet msl.  At 1359:10, the airplane was about 1.14 nm east-northeast of COQKU at an altitude of 13,600 feet msl.  About that time, the airplane entered a right turn and proceeded northbound about 1.4 miles.  At 1359:34 and 1359:46, the corresponding Mode C altitudes were 12,200 feet and 12,500 feet, respectively.  The airplane subsequently entered a second right turn, tracking eastbound for about 0.85 mile.  The final three data points were each located within 505 feet (0.08 mile) laterally of each other and of the approximate location of the accident site.  The data point recorded at 1400:10 did not have Mode C altitude data associated with it.  At 1400:22, the associated Mode C altitude was 10,100 feet.  The final data point was recorded at 1400:34, with an associated Mode C altitude of 8,700 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nU. S. Department of the Interior / Bureau of Reclamation data indicated that the elevation of the Ridgway Reservoir was about 6,870 feet on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with single-engine land airplane and instrument airplane ratings. He was issued a third class airman medical certificate with a limitation for corrective lenses on February 12, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's logbook, denoted logbook number \"02,\" was reviewed by the NTSB.  The initial entry in this logbook was dated March 24, 2012, and the final entry was dated January 4, 2014.  According to this logbook, the pilot had accumulated a total flight time of about 908 hours in single-engine land airplanes, 839 hours as pilot-in-command, 211 hours dual instruction received, 71 hours actual instrument, 46 hours simulated instrument, and 133 hours night flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe logbook included two entries attributable to the accident airplane, dated January 3 and 4, 2014, totaling 8.6 hours.  These were also the only entries attributable to the same make and model aircraft as the accident airplane.  These entries included a notation for one instrument landing system (ILS) approach.  The logbook included flight review and instrument proficiency check endorsements dated January 4, 2014.  The logbook also included an endorsement for high-altitude, pressurized airplane training as required by 14 CFR 61.31(g).  According to the logbook endorsements, both the instrument proficiency check and the pressurized airplane endorsements were completed in a TBM 700 airplane.  The logbook also included an entry for 12 hours of ground instruction covering TBM 700 systems and high altitude operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData obtained from a commercial flight tracking company indicated that a total of 12 flights related to the accident airplane were on file between December 27, 2013, and March 22, 2014.  These flights totaled 28 hours and 2 minutes of flight time.  However, no information regarding the pilot-in-command, any fight plan filed, or the flight conditions, was associated with the data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe accident airplane was a 1996 Socata TBM 700, serial number 112. It was a six-place, single-engine airplane, with a pressurized cabin and a retractable tricycle landing gear configuration.  The airplane was equipped with an ice protection system and was approved for flight into known icing conditions, with the exception of severe icing conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was powered by a 700 shaft-horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-64 turbo-propeller engine, serial number 111098, and a 4-blade, constant speed (adjustable pitch) Hartzell model HC-E4N-3/E9083SK propeller assembly. The accident airplane was issued an FAA normal category, standard airworthiness certificate in December 1996.  The accident owner, Gadsden Aviation, LLC, purchased the airplane on December 30, 2013.  The accident pilot signed the registration application as an authorized member of Gadsden Aviation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane maintenance records, the most recent annual inspection was completed on November 21, 2013.  At the time of that inspection, the airframe total time was 4,785.1 hours, with a total of 3,593 cycles.  The recording hour (Hobbs) meter reportedly indicated 4,334.1 hours.  The engine had accumulated 4,785.1 hours, with 2,806.4 hours and 1,235.1 hours since the most recent overhaul and the most recent hot section inspection, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA subsequent maintenance record entry, dated December 30, 2013, which corresponded to the most recent sale date for the airplane, indicated that the logbooks were reviewed in accordance with the customer's request.  In addition, a walk-around inspection was completed at that time, with no findings noted.  The maintenance record contained no further entries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recording hour (Hobbs) meter indicated 4,397.6 hours at the time of the postaccident examination.  This is consistent with the airplane accumulating 63.5 hours since the annual inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nWeather conditions recorded by the MTJ Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), located about 19 miles north-northwest of the accident site, at 1353, were: wind from 210 degrees at 9 knots; few clouds at 1,500 feet above ground level (agl), broken clouds at 3,000 feet agl, overcast clouds at 3,900 feet agl; 10 miles visibility with light rain; temperature 5 degrees Celsius; dew point 2 degrees Celsius; and altimeter 30.10 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) for KMTJ issued at 1134 and current at the time of the accident, was: wind from 270° at 11 knots, visibility of greater than 6 statute miles, showers between 5 and 10 miles from the airport, ceiling broken at 5,000 feet agl, overcast clouds at 10,000 feet agl. Temporary conditions between 1400 and 1600 were: visibility six statute miles, light rain showers, scattered clouds at 3,000 agl, ceiling broken at 4,000 feet agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn area forecast covering Colorado was issued at 1345.  For the mountainous areas of Colorado, the forecast included broken cloud bases at 12,000 feet msl, with tops to 16,000 feet msl.  Occasional visibilities between 3 and 5 miles in widely scattered light snow showers were also forecast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to the 1345 area forecast, an amended area forecast that included Colorado was issued at 0545.  The portion of the area forecast applicable to the southern half of the mountains in Colorado, west of the Continental Divide forecasted for the accident time: a broken cloud ceiling at 10,000 feet msl, with additional cloud layers to flight level (FL) 250, and occasional visibility of 3 – 5 miles in widely scattered light snow showers and mist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisory for icing was issued at 0845.  The AIRMET advisory area encompassed most of Colorado, including the accident site.  The AIRMET warned of the possibility of moderate icing between the freezing level and 19,000 feet, with conditions continuing through 2100.  Freezing levels were forecast to range from the surface to 12,000 feet across the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn AIRMET advisory for turbulence was also in effect beginning at 0845.  The advisory area encompassed portions of central and southern Colorado, and central and northern New Mexico.  The accident site was located near the northwest boundary of the advisory area.  The AIRMET warned of the possibility of moderate turbulence below 14,000 feet, with conditions continuing through 2100.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe North American Mesoscale model sounding for the accident location at 1500 identified a humid layer from near the surface to 30,000 feet.  Near surface wind was about 10 knots from the west-southwest, increasing to about 50 knots from the west through 23,000 feet msl.  Calculations by the Rawinsonde Observation Program (RAOB) suggested few to broken cloud condition from the surface through about 21,000 feet msl, with light rime or mixed icing between 12,000 and 16,000 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite imagery identified cloudy conditions along the latter portion of the accident airplane's flight path.  The coldest cloud-top temperatures in the vicinity of this portion of the flight were -30 degrees Celsius, which corresponded to heights of approximately 29,500 msl.  However, the cloud top temperatures varied from -30 degrees Celsius to +2 degrees Celsius along this portion of the flight path.  Weather radar data identified hydrometeor classification associated with dry snow, with some nearby ice crystals.  In addition, radial velocity measurements identified some potential for wind shear between 12,000 feet and 16,000 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pilot report (PIREP) was received about 1520 that noted light rime ice and moderate chop/turbulence between 13,000 feet msl and 17,000 feet msl about 30 miles north-northeast of MTJ.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe Montrose Regional Airport (MTJ) was located about 1 mile northwest of the City of Montrose at an elevation of 5,759 feet.  It was served by two paved runways:  runway 17-35 was 10,000 feet long by 150 feet wide; runway 13-31 was 7,510 feet long by 100 feet wide.  Both runways were constructed of asphalt.  The airport was non-towered and operations were supported by a common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), commonly referred to as Unicom.  Denver ARTCC provided air traffic control services for the surrounding airspace.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInstrument flight rules (IFR) operations into MTJ were supported by six FAA-approved terminal approach procedures. Runway 35 was served by an RNAV (GPS) approach.  For aircraft initially southeast of the airport, the procedure provided an initial approach fix at YARUB navigation fix.  The minimum altitude for the initial segment beginning at YARUB was 12,000 feet msl.  The approach procedure subsequently required a right turn to the north-northwest toward MTJ at the COQKU navigation fix.  The minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 6,380 feet msl.  One mile visibility was required to descend from the MDA and land.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest inverted about 60 feet below the surface of the Ridgeway Reservoir, near the eastern shore.  The aft fuselage/empennage had separated from the airframe at a point near the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. The aft fuselage/empennage section was observed floating near the western edge of the reservoir by local authorities. The aft fuselage/empennage section was recovered separately from the surface of the reservoir.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wings, engine and propeller remained attached to the fuselage.  The entire lower surface of the fuselage, wings and engine cowling exhibited upward crushing damage.  The uniform extent of the damage appeared consistent with a near level attitude, upright impact with the surface of the reservoir.  A partial circumferential fracture (tear) of the fuselage skin was located approximately in-line with the wing trailing edges. The empennage/aft fuselage section had separated about 2 feet aft of the aft pressure bulkhead. The aft pressure bulkhead was deformed over the lower one-third of the panel, but appeared otherwise intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was dislocated from the surrounding airframe structure.  The pilot and co-pilot control wheels remained in place relative to the panel.  The throttle quadrant was partially dislocated from the instrument panel.  Aileron control continuity was confirmed within the fuselage from each wing root to the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left wing was deformed and damaged over the entire span.  The lower wing skin was deformed upward and into the underlying sub-structure over the entire inboard one-half of the span.  The inboard portion of both the forward and aft wing spars, including the wing-to-fuselage attachment lugs, appeared intact and undeformed.  The left aileron was partially separated.  The hinge fittings appeared fractured consistent with overstress.  Aileron control continuity was confirmed from the control surface to the wing root.  The left flap was separated from the wing completely and recovered from the reservoir.  The flap assembly was separated into two sections near the mid-span hinge.  The actuator extension was consistent with a flaps-up position.  The spoiler panel remained attached to the wing and the control linkage was intact.  The left main landing gear was in the retracted position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right wing was deformed and damaged over the entire span.  The lower wing skin was deformed upward and into the underlying sub-structure over the entire span.  The inboard portion of both the forward and aft wing spars, including the wing-to-fuselage attachment lugs, appeared intact and undeformed.  The right aileron was separated and not recovered from the reservoir.  However, the outboard aileron closure rib remained attached to the hinge and the aileron control push-pull tube.  Aileron control continuity was confirmed to the wing root.  The flap assembly was separated into two sections near the mid-span hinge, with the outboard portion remaining partially attached to the wing.  The inboard portion was not recovered.  The actuator extension was consistent with a flaps-up position.  The spoiler panel remained attached to the wing, and the control linkage was intact.  The right main landing gear was in the retracted position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage/aft fuselage section had separated from the remainder of the airframe near the forward edge of the vertical stabilizer.  The separation appeared consistent with an overstress failure.  The fuselage section was crushed upward.  The horizontal stabilizers remained attached to the aft fuselage section.  The left horizontal stabilizer appeared intact.  The left elevator remained attached to the stabilizer and the left trim tab remained attached to the elevator.  The left elevator inboard bellcrank and torque tube remained attached to the centerline hinge point.  The right horizontal stabilizer exhibited a deformation/buckle at the root adjacent to the fuselage. The right elevator had separated from the horizontal stabilizer and was not recovered from the reservoir.  The upper and lower elevator stops remained secured to the centerline elevator hinge.  The stops appeared to be intact and undeformed.  The lower (down) elevator stops did not exhibit any marks consistent with contact from the elevators.  The upper elevator stops exhibited marks consistent with contact from the elevators at the upper limit of travel.  Full upward deflection of the elevators is consistent with an upright, level attitude impact with the reservoir surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nElevator control continuity was confirmed to the left elevator, with the exception of a separation of the elevator control rod aft of the fuselage aft pressure bulkhead; the separation appeared consistent with overstress. The right elevator control tube was separated immediately forward of the elevator attachment point.  (The right elevator was separated as previously noted.)  The elevator control rods forward of the aft pressure bulkhead were deformed consistent with the surrounding fuselage impact damage.  However, the control rods were attached and continuous to the cockpit area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rudder remained attached to the vertical stabilizer, and the rudder trim tab remained attached to the rudder.  The lower edge of the rudder trim tab was deformed.  An impression was observed on the upper surface of the right horizontal stabilizer that appeared to match the size and shape of the lower surface of the rudder trim tab.  At the time of the examination, the rudder trim tab was deflected to the right relative to the rudder trailing edge. The location of the impression appeared consistent with the rudder being deflected to the right at or near the extent of travel at the moment of impact.  Rudder control continuity was confirmed to the aft fuselage rudder lever assembly.  The rudder control cable sector remained attached to the lever assembly; however, a portion of the sector had separated.  The fracture surface appeared consistent with an overstress failure.  In addition, one rudder cable also failed forward of the control sector; the cable separation was frayed consistent with an overload failure.  The rudder control cables were otherwise continuous to the cockpit controls.  The rudder trim tab remained attached to the trim actuator linkage.  Examination of the rudder trim motor assembly revealed damage consistent with water immersion.  However, electrical continuity of the trim motor and the pilot/co-pilot rudder trim switches was confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the engine mount.  The mount was deformed consistent with impact forces.  Visual examination of the engine revealed that the compressor inlet and gas generator cases had partially separated along the upper circumference of the mounting flanges.  The exhaust ducts were deformed and crushed upward.  The reduction gearbox exhibited damage consistent with impact.  The reduction gearbox chip detector was free of metallic (ferrous) debris.  The accessory gearbox appeared undamaged.  The accessory gearbox coupling spline was separated; the appearance of the fracture surface was consistent with overstress.  Engine control continuity was confirmed from each component to the firewall.  The oil, fuel, and air filters appeared clean and unobstructed.  The engine compressor and turbine sections exhibited circumferential scoring, smearing, and heating discoloration consistent with rotation at impact.  The combustion chamber exhibited normal operating signatures with no indication of operational distress.  Testing of the fuel pump revealed no anomalies.  Testing of the fuel control unit determined that fuel flow values were higher than factory settings.  However, the settings were consistent with field adjustments and/or issues with water immersion, and they remained within range to allow normal engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller assembly remained attached to the engine reduction gear assembly.  All propeller blades remained attached to the hub and were deformed.  Each blade appeared to be in the feathered position at the time of recovery.  The spinner was crushed and torn, but was attached to the propeller assembly at the time of recovery.  The engine/propeller mounting appeared intact, and all eight mounting bolts were securely installed and safety wired.  The pitch change mechanism, including the cylinder, piston, pitch change rod, fork, and feathering spring and guides appeared intact.  Both the low pitch and the feather stops appeared to be intact.  The preload plates corresponding to two of the blades exhibited impression marks associated with the fork bumper.  The impressions corresponded to a blade angle of approximately 26 degrees at the time the impressions were made, which are within the normal operating range of the propeller assembly.  Testing of the propeller governor did not reveal any anomalies that would have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the pilot was conducted at the Montrose Memorial Hospital, Montrose, Colorado, on March 28, 2014, by the authority of the Ouray county coroner. The pilot's death was attributed to multiple traumatic injuries sustained in the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute toxicology report stated that Yohimbine was detected in urine and liver.  No ethanol was detected in vitreous.  Yohimbine is a prescription Alpha 2 blocker.  It is also available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not report any significant medical issues or any medication usage on his most recent medical certificate application, nor did the FAA-designated medical examiner identify any significant issues during the physical examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) noted the following in the case of an accidental spin:&#x0D;\n1)\tControl wheel . . . Neutral: Pitch and Roll&#x0D;\n2)\tRudder . . . Fully Opposed to the Spin&#x0D;\n3)\tPower lever . . . Idle&#x0D;\n4)\tFlaps . . . Up&#x0D;\nWhen rotation is stopped . . .&#x0D;\n5)\tLevel the wings and ease out of the dive.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe POH also noted that voluntary (intentional) spins are prohibited. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that moderate rime ice had accumulated on the airplane during the inbound flight to the fixed-base operator (FBO). FBO employees reported seeing 1 1/2- to 2-inch thick ice on the wings' unprotected surfaces, the left wing's radome, and the propeller spinner and around the stall indicator when the airplane arrived. The pilot removed some of the ice with his hand and declined an offer to have the airplane deiced or put it in a heated hangar. Subsequently, the airplane was parked outside at the FBO for about 1 hour, during which time it was snowing and sleeting. Witnesses reported that they did not see the pilot check the tail surfaces for ice and that, when the airplane taxied for takeoff, they saw ice on portions of the airplane, including the radome, and snow on the wings' surfaces. The pilot reported that, during takeoff, the left wing dropped and was not generating lift, likely due to the ice on the airplane's surface. The airplane veered left, impacted terrain, and then caught on fire before coming to rest. A postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any failure that would have resulted in the loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On February 10, 2012, at 0829 central standard time, a Socata TBM 700 airplane, N850LM, collided with the terrain following a loss of control on takeoff at the Dane County Regional Airport (MSN), Madison, Wisconsin. The pilot and two passengers received minor injuries. The airplane received substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. The airplane was registered to Precision Aviation LLC and was operated by a private pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and in instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight was originating at the time of the accident with an intended destination of Fort Myers, Florida.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had flown from Appleton, Wisconsin to MSN and was on the ground at MSN for approximately one hour prior to the accident departure. During the inbound flight from Appleton, the pilot reported to air traffic control that the airplane picked up moderate rime ice between 3,000 feet and 10,000 feet and that the ice was coming off the airplane as it descended. The pilot stated he did not have any problem controlling the airplane and after landing, he \"manually\" removed the ice that remained on the airplane, ate breakfast, had the airplane fueled, and walked around the airplane to \"…confirm no ice remained on wing and other surfaces.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported he began the takeoff rotation at 85 knots and once airborne, the left wing began to drop with no lift being generated from the left wing. The pilot stated he lowered the nose of the airplane and applied right rudder in an attempt to land the airplane back on the runway. The airplane veered to the left and impacted the terrain near the intersection of runway 32/14 and taxiway B. The airplane then slid about 900 feet through the intersection and came to rest in the grass north of taxiway C, at which time the pilot and passengers noticed the airplane was on fire. They were unable to open the main cabin door, so they exited through the emergency door. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outboard section of the left wing sustained impact and fire damage. Scorch marks were visible on the pavement and grass along the wreckage path. The entire left side of the airplane was covered with soot from the postimpact fire. The right side of the airplane was relatively soot free and the outboard section of the right wing was bent upward. The propeller and engine cowling were separated from the airplane. A postaccident examination of the wreckage was conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration. Flight control continuity was established during the examination and no failure or malfunction of the airplane was identified that would have resulted in the loss of control. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree employees of the fixed base operator (FBO) at MSN reported seeing ice that was 1½ to 2 inches thick on the unprotected surfaces of the wings, the radome on the left wing, around the stall indicator, and on the propeller spinner when the airplane arrived. They reported seeing the pilot breaking the ice off of portions of the airplane with his hands. None of the FBO personnel saw the pilot check the tail surfaces. The pilot was offered deicing services and a heated hangar in which to put the airplane, but he declined both. Two of the employees reported hearing one of the passengers voice concern to the pilot about the ice on the airplane, but the pilot did not seem to be concerned. The person who fueled the airplane stated it was snowing and sleeting when he fueled the airplane. FBO personnel reported there was ice on portions of the airplane, including the radome, and snow had accumulated on the wing surfaces when the airplane taxied for takeoff. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0832, the MSN Automated Surface Observing System recorded weather conditions as: Wind calm; 2 miles visibility with light snow and mist; scattered clouds at 1,200 feet, overcast clouds at 1,900 feet; temperature 0 degrees Celsius; dew point minus 2 degrees Celsius; altimeter 29.90 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 Integrated Flight Deck. The data on the SD card from the multi-function display (MFD) was downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Division. The last seven seconds of data showed that the indicated airspeed increased from 87.63 knots to 95.82 knots. The pitch attitude increased from 1.49 degrees to 15.88 degrees nose up; then decreased to 11.47 degrees nose up, and then decreased further to 11.21 degrees nose down. The left bank angle during the last 7 seconds increased from 1.15 degrees to 60.59 degrees. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Although the pilot filed an instrument flight rules flight plan through the Direct User Access Terminal System (DUATS), no evidence of a weather briefing was found. The flight departed in visual meteorological conditions and entered instrument meteorological conditions while climbing through 12,800 feet. The air traffic controller advised the pilot of moderate rime icing from 15,000 feet through 17,000 feet, with light rime ice at 14,000 feet. The controller asked the pilot to advise him if the icing worsened, and the pilot responded that he would let them know and that it was no problem for him. The controller informed the pilot that he was coordinating for a higher altitude. The pilot confirmed that, while at 16,800 feet, \"…light icing has been present for a little while and a higher altitude would be great.\" About 15 seconds later, the pilot stated that he was getting a little rattle and requested a higher altitude as soon as possible. About 25 seconds after that, the flight was cleared to flight level 200, and the pilot acknowledged. About one minute later, the airplane reached a peak altitude of 17,800 feet before turning sharply to the left and entering a descent. While descending through 17,400 feet, the pilot stated, \"and N731CA's declaring…\" No subsequent transmissions were received from the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted the paved surfaces and a wooded median on an interstate highway. A postaccident fire resulted. The outboard section of the right wing and several sections of the empennage, including the horizontal stabilizer, elevator, and rudder, were found about 1/4 mile southwest of the fuselage, in a residential area. Witnesses reported seeing pieces of the airplane separating during flight and the airplane in a rapid descent. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the outboard section of the right wing separated in flight, at a relatively low altitude, and then struck and severed portions of the empennage. There was no evidence of a preexisting mechanical anomaly that would have precluded normal operation of the airframe or engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of weather information revealed that numerous pilots reported icing conditions in the general area before and after the accident. At least three flight crews considered the icing \"severe.\" Although severe icing was not forecasted, an Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisory included moderate icing at altitudes at which the accident pilot was flying. The pilot operating handbook warned that the airplane was not certificated for flight in severe icing conditions and that, if encountered, the pilot must exit severe icing immediately by changing altitude or routing. Although the pilot was coordinating for a higher altitude with the air traffic controller at the time of the icing encounter, it is likely that he either did not know the severity of the icing or he was reluctant to exercise his command authority in order to immediately exit the icing conditions.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 20, 2011, about 1005 eastern standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N731CA, collided with terrain following an in-flight loss of aircraft control near Morristown, New Jersey. The airplane was registered to Cool Stream LLC and was operated by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight from Teterboro, New Jersey (TEB) to Atlanta, Georgia (PDK). The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The certificated private pilot and four passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The flight originated from TEB about 0950.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 20, 2011, at 0700, an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight using the Direct User Access Terminal System (DUATS). The flight plan listed a cruising speed of 292 knots and an en route altitude of flight level (FL) 260. At 0930, TEB clearance delivery issued an IFR clearance to the pilot and he subsequently contacted TEB ground control at 0943 for taxi clearance. The pilot was cleared to taxi to runway 6 and at 0948 the pilot reported that he was ready for departure for runway 6. According to air traffic control (ATC) recorded communications between TEB local control, ground control, and the pilot, weather information was not requested by, nor issued to, the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the departure climb, while passing 8,000 feet for 10,000 feet, the pilot was directed to climb and maintain 14,000 feet. The controller then advised the pilot of moderate rime icing from 15,000 feet through 17,000 feet with light rime ice at 14,000 feet. The controller asked that the pilot advise him if the icing got worse, and the pilot responded with, “we’ll let you know what happens when we get in there and if we could go straight through, it’s no problem for us.” At 0958:24, the controller directed the pilot to climb and maintain 17,000 feet and to contact New York Center (ZNY). While climbing between 12,800 and 12,900 feet, at 116 knots ground speed, the pilot acknowledged and advised that they were entering instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1002:17, the ZNY controller advised the pilot that he would be cleared to a higher altitude when ATC could provide it, and that light icing would be encountered at 17,000 feet. The pilot responded with, “I can confirm that light icing…” and stated that, “…light icing has been present for a little while and a higher altitude would be great.” The altitude of the airplane at that time was 16,800 feet and 101 knots ground speed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1002:34, the pilot reported, “we’re getting a little rattle here can we ah get ah higher as soon as possible please.” The ZNY controller responded with “stand by” and coordinated for a higher altitude with an adjacent sector controller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1002:59, the ZNY controller directed the pilot to climb and maintain FL200 and the pilot acknowledged. At 1004:08, the airplane reached an altitude of 17,800 feet before it turned about 70 degrees to the left and entered a descent. At 1004:29, while descending through 17,400 feet, and at 90 knots ground speed, the pilot transmitted, “and N731CA’s declaring…” No subsequent radio transmissions were heard from the pilot. The final radar return at 1005:17 was observed at an altitude of 2,000 feet, about 600 yards west of the main wreckage impact site. The previous return, recorded 9 seconds earlier, indicated 6,200 feet. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous witnesses observed the airplane during the accident sequence. A consistent observation was that the airplane descended at a rapid rate, and was trailing smoke. At least five witnesses saw pieces of the airplane separate during flight or they observed the airplane descending without a wing attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 45, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. He reported a total flight experience of 1,400 hours on his latest second-class medical certificate application, dated July 14, 2011. The pilot’s personal logbook(s) were not located after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed a TBM 700 two-day recurrent training course at the SIMCOM Training Center, Orlando, Florida on November 15, 2011. According to a representative from SIMCOM, ground training was accomplished that addressed the technical aspects of the installed ice protection and environmental systems, including preflight checking and testing. Normal and emergency checklist procedures were also discussed. Simulator training consisted of system checking, testing, and operation, including operating in icing conditions, at altitude, and system malfunctions. The SIMCOM representative stated that, “It is always stressed that the installed ice protection systems are intended to provide protection while departing icing conditions.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSIMCOM training records showed that the pilot completed a similar recurrent course on November 15 and 16, 2010.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was manufactured in 2005 and was equipped with a single Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A-64 turbo-prop engine. The airplane was issued a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on September 22, 2005 and was registered to Cool Stream LLC on October 25, 2005. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe most recent annual inspection was performed on July 27, 2011. At that time, the airplane had accumulated approximately 702.0 total flight hours. The last logbook entry was recorded on November 18, 2011, at an aircraft total time of 724.6 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe public docket for this accident contains a Meteorology Factual Report and numerous attachments to support that report. All times that follow in this section are expressed in eastern standard time unless otherwise noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of the Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT), the DUATS, and Lockheed Martin Flight Services revealed that the pilot did not access weather services or receive a telephone weather briefing prior to the accident flight. It was not determined if the pilot received weather information from other sources.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest surface weather observation was at Morristown Municipal Airport (MMU), located about 3 miles east-northeast of the accident site at an elevation of 187 feet. The 0945 observation reported wind from 360 degrees at 8 knots with gusts to 13 knots, visibility of 10 miles or greater, ceiling overcast at 20,000 feet, temperature 6 degrees C, dew point -2 degrees C, and altimeter setting 30.17 inches of mercury. No precipitation was noted in the observation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 0951 surface weather observation for TEB, located about 20 miles east-northeast of the accident site at an elevation of 9 feet, included sky clear and visibility of 10 miles or greater.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 1000 depicted a low pressure center near the Indiana/Ohio border with a stationary front extending east through Ohio into western Pennsylvania. A cold front extended from this point eastward through southern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, and continued over coastal waters. No present weather symbols were depicted in the accident region.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe portion of the Area Forecast directed toward northern New Jersey and in effect until 1000 included the following, ceilings overcast at 7,000 feet and cloud tops to FL180. The conditions between 1000 and 1600 forecasted ceilings broken at 15,000 feet. The Area Forecast Discussion issued at 0956 did not discuss any icing hazard to aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Airmen’s Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisory, “ZULU,” was issued at 0945 that included the area of the accident site. The AIRMET advised of moderate icing between the freezing level (identified as located between 2,000 feet and 8,000 feet) and FL200.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to the 0945 AIRMET ZULU, an amended AIRMET ZULU was issued at 0645. The amended AIRMET advised of moderate icing between the freezing level (identified as located between 3,000 feet and 9,000 feet) and FL180.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot reports made over New Jersey, southern New York, and eastern Pennsylvania between 0800 and 1300 were reviewed by investigators. More than 80 reports were compiled. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn urgent pilot report was received at 0749 from a pilot operating a Cessna Citation at 14,000 feet, about 15 nautical miles southwest of Modena, Pennsylvania. The pilot reported moderate to severe rime icing between 13,000 and 14,000 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn urgent pilot report was received at 1042 from “multiple” types of aircraft at 14,000 feet near Schooley’s Mountain, New Jersey. The report included severe rime icing between 14,000 and 17,500 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn urgent pilot report was received at 0808 from a flight crew operating a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft at 14,000 feet over MMU. The pilot reported moderate to severe rime icing between 14,000 and 16,500 feet. One of the flight crewmembers reported that the icing was the worst he had seen in 38 years of flying experience and that he had never seen ice accumulate so quickly. He described “golf ball-sized” accumulation on the windshield wiper.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn interview with the captain of a Bombardier CRJ aircraft that was operating close to the accident aircraft reported that the wing anti-ice system could not “keep up” with the accumulation. He estimated 2.5 inches of ice on the protected areas of the wing, and 4 inches accumulation on some unprotected areas in a time span of about five minutes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted the paved surfaces and a wooded median on Interstate Highway 287, about 1 mile south of Morristown. The point of initial impact of the main wreckage was in the southbound lanes, at coordinates 40 46.573 north, 074 28.624 west. The main wreckage debris field was oriented on a heading of about 070 degrees and was about 350 feet in length. The propeller assembly separated from the engine during impact and came to rest in a wooded area on the east side of the northbound lanes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA post-crash fire was evident on the highway and in the wooded median, where sections of the fuselage, the left wing, and the vertical stabilizer came to rest.  Due to the impact damage and fragmentation of the cockpit, cabin, and fuselage, the seating positions of the airplane occupants was not determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outboard section of the right wing and several sections of the empennage, including the horizontal stabilizer, elevator, and rudder, were found between 0.20 and 0.23 nautical miles southwest of the fuselage, in a residential area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a storage facility in Clayton, Delaware, where an examination and partial reconstruction of the wreckage was performed on January 3 and 4, 2012. The examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of a pre-accident mechanical malfunction or anomaly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA visual inspection of the pneumatic leading edge de-ice boots revealed no pre-existing ruptures or cracks and all observable boot fasteners were intact and secure. Impact damage prevented functional testing of the aircraft de-ice systems. The cockpit de-ice system panel was found intact. The airframe de-ice, propeller de-ice, pitot heat 1 and 2, and stall warning heater switches were found in the “ON” positions. The ice inspection light, the left and right windshield de-ice, and the inertial separator switches were found in the “OFF” positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the C6 and C8 carry-through structure, where the wings were attached to the fuselage, exhibited twisting and bending distortion at the right wing attachment points, in the up and aft direction.  The carry-through structure was fragmented. All fracture surfaces exhibited overload signatures. No evidence of pre-existing cracks or fatigue was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the outboard section of the right wing revealed that the wing tip, aileron, and spoiler were still attached. Examination of the aileron attachment and actuator hardware revealed no evidence of stop-to-stop damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer was separated from the airframe at location C21, with the C21 frame still attached to the assembly. The right-hand horizontal stabilizer was fractured in half, near the midpoint on the right-hand leading edge. The outboard half of the right-hand stabilizer was found adjacent to the larger portion that included the left-hand horizontal stabilizer and C21 frame. The right elevator was still attached to the outboard section of the right horizontal stabilizer by the trim tab actuators. The left elevator was attached to the left horizontal stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the examination of the airframe structure, the outboard section of the right wing was manually positioned, or “mated,” with the leading edge of the right-hand horizontal stabilizer to explore the possibility of in-flight contact. The examination revealed that deformation on the leading edge of the right wing was consistent with an in-flight contact with the leading edge of the right-hand horizontal stabilizer.  Also, impact signatures and damage observed on the right wing leading edge, near positions N19 and N20, were consistent with an in-flight collision with the right side of the rudder.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine displayed contact signatures at the compressor first stage and shroud, compressor turbine, compressor turbine shroud, first stage power turbine vane ring, first stage power turbine, first stage power turbine shroud, second stage power turbine vane ring, second stage power turbine, and the second stage power turbine shroud. The engine housing exhibited severe radial deformation around the right hand circumference resulting in circumferential impact fractures of the compressor turbine blades and the first and second stage power turbine blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe examination of the propeller revealed that three of the propeller blades remained attached to the propeller hub and a fourth blade separated into two sections. The blades exhibited twisting, chord-wise scratching, “s” bending, and blade tip separations. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postmortem examination of the pilot was performed at the County of Morris Medical Examiner’s Office, Morristown, New Jersey, on December 21, 2011. The autopsy report noted the cause of death as “multiple injuries” and the manner of death was “accident.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology testing was performed on specimens of the pilot by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "In anticipation of the maintenance test flight, a about 72 gallons of fuel was added to the left fuel tank to balance the fuel load. During the preflight, the pilot noted that the left tank had 105 gallons and that the right tank had 108 gallons. Because of the fuel level indications, the pilot did not visually inspect the tanks; even if he had done so the wing dihedral would have prevented him from seeing the fuel level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the pilot received the first annunciation of \"Fuel Low R,\" which lasted for about 10 seconds then went out. This indicates the fuel quantity is less than or equal to 9 gallons of usable fuel in the right tank. The pilot attributed this to a malfunction of the low fuel level sensor, since the fuel gauge showed about 98 gallons of fuel. He instructed the right front seat occupant (the mechanic) to make a note so the sensor would be replaced after the flight. Shortly thereafter, the amber \"Fuel Unbalance\" illuminated, and indicated that the right fuel quantity was greater than the left; as a result the pilot switched the fuel selector to the right tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe then initiated a descent to 10,000 feet to perform system checks, and after levelling off at that altitude for about 15 minutes, received a second \"Fuel Low R\" annunciation; he verified that the fuel selector automatically switched to the left tank and noted that the message went out after about 10 seconds. Either before or during a descent to 4,000 feet, the second \"Fuel Unbalance\" annunciation occurred. The right tank again depicted a greater quantity of fuel, so the pilot again switched the fuel selector to the right tank. The flight continued to a nearby airport, where the pilot terminated an instrument approach with a low approach. The flight then proceeded to the destination airport and entered the traffic pattern on a left downwind leg..&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile on the downwind leg, the pilot received the third \"Fuel Unbalance\" annunciation and at this time the left fuel gauge indicated 55 gallons while the right fuel gauge indicated 74 gallons. Because he intended to land within a few minutes, the pilot manually selected the fullest (right) tank, then turned to base then final. While at 800 feet on final approach, the red warning message \"Fuel Press\" illuminated and the engine lost all power. Attempts to restore engine power were unsuccessful. Unable to reach the airport, the pilot landed on a nearby turnpike. Both fuel tanks were breached, and fuel leakage, likely  from the left fuel tank, was noted at the site. Inspection of the fuel outlet filter on the engine and the fuel sequencer reservoir considered an airframe item revealed both contained minimal fuel consistent with fuel starvation from the right fuel tank that actually did not contain an adequate supply of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident operational testing of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction that would have resulted in the loss of power. Examination and testing of the right fuel gauge harness revealed that a high impedance shielded cable was not correctly soldered to the shielding braid when the airplane was manufactured, which resulted in erroneous high readings of the fuel quantity in the right tank. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral opportunities existed to detect the fuel quantity errors in the right tank during the airplane's 600-hour and annual inspection, which was signed off the day before. Several times during the inspection, electrical power was applied and different fuel quantities for the right tank were displayed, yet nothing was done to determine the reason for the different fuel indications. For example, 41 gallons was displayed, yet 70 gallons was drained; the fuel was returned to the tank after maintenance, yet the gauge showed 51 gallons, and after a post-maintenance run was performed, the gauge showed over 140 gallons even though it hadn't been fueled. Maintenance personnel incorrectly attributed the difference to fuel migration. Further, the pilot had the opportunity to terminate the test flight after multiple conflicting indications from  the right tank, yet he continued the test flight, which resulted in fuel starvation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 12, 2011, about 1334 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N37SV, registered to SV Leasing Company of Florida, operated by SOCATA North America, Inc., sustained substantial damage during a forced landing on a highway near Hollywood, Florida, following total loss of engine power. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 maintenance test flight from North Perry Airport (HWO), Hollywood, Florida. The airline transport pilot and pilot-rated other crewmember sustained minor injuries; there were no ground injuries. The flight originated from HWO about 1216.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was a maintenance test flight following a 600 hour and annual inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the right front seat occupant, in anticipation of the flight, he checked the fuel load by applying electrical power and noted the G1000 indicated the left fuel tank had approximately 36 gallons while the right fuel tank had approximately 108 gallons. In an effort to balance the fuel load with the indication of the right fuel tank, he added 72.4 gallons of fuel to the left fuel tank. At the start of the data recorded by the G1000 for the accident flight, the recorded capacity in the left fuel tank was approximately 105 gallons while the amount in the right fuel tank was approximately 108 gallons.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PIC reported that because of the fuel load on-board, he could not see the level of fuel in the tanks; therefore, he did not visually check the fuel tanks. By cockpit indication, the left tank had approximately 105 gallons and the right tank had approximately 108 gallons. The flight departed HWO, but he could not recall the fuel selector position beneath the thrust lever quadrant. He further stated that the fuel selector switch on the overhead panel was in the \"auto\" position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter takeoff, the flight climbed to flight level (FL) 280, and levelled off at that altitude about 20 minutes after takeoff. While at that altitude they received a \"Fuel Low R\" amber warning CAS message on the G1000. He checked the right fuel gauge which indicated 98 gallons, and confirmed that the fuel selector automatically switched to the left tank. After about 10 seconds the amber warning CAS message went out. He attributed the annunciation to be associated with a failure or malfunction of the sensor, and told the mechanic to write this issue down so it could be replaced after the flight. The flight continued and they received an amber warning CAS message, \"Fuel Unbalance\" which the right fuel tank had more fuel so he switched the fuel selector to supply fuel from the right tank to the engine. The G1000 indicates they remained at that altitude for approximately 8 minutes.&#x0D;\nHe then initiated a quick descent to 10,000 feet mean sea level (msl) and during the descent accelerated to Vmo to test the aural warning horn. They descended to and maintained 10,000 feet msl for about 15 minutes and at an unknown time, they received an amber warning CAS message \"Fuel Low R.\" Once again he checked the right fuel gauge which indicated it had 92 gallons and confirmed that the fuel tank selector automatically switched to the left tank. After about 10 seconds the CAS message went out. Either just before or during descent to 4,000 feet, they received an amber CAS message \"Fuel Unbalance.\" Because the right fuel gauge indicated the fullest tank was the right tank, he switched the fuel selector to supply fuel to the engine from the right tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight proceeded to the Opa-Locka Executive Airport, where he executed an ILS approach which terminated with a low approach. The pilot cancelled the IFR clearance and proceeded VFR towards HWO. While in contact with the HWO air traffic control tower, the flight was cleared to join the left downwind for runway 27L. Upon entering the downwind leg they received another amber CAS message \"Fuel Unbalance\" and at this time the left fuel gauge indicated 55 gallons while the right fuel gauge indicated 74 gallons. Because he intended on landing within a few minutes, he put the fuel selector to the manual position and switched to the fullest (right) tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEstablished on final approach to runway 27L at HWO with the gear down, flaps set to landing, and minimum speed requested by air traffic for separation (85 knots indicated airspeed). When the flight was at 800 feet, the red warning CAS message \"Fuel Press\" illuminated and the right seat occupant with his permission moved the auxiliary fuel boost pump switch from \"Auto\" to \"On\" while he, PIC manually moved the fuel selector to the left tank. In an effort to restore engine power he pushed the power lever and used the manual over-ride but with no change. Assured that the engine had quit, he put the condition lever to cutoff, the starter switch on, and then the condition lever to \"Hi-Idle\" attempting to perform an airstart. At 1332:42, a flightcrew member of the airplane advised the HWO ATCT, \"…just lost the engine\"; however, the controller did not reply.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PIC stated that he looked to his left and noticed a clear area on part of the turnpike, so he banked left, and in anticipation of the forced landing, placed the power lever to idle, the condition lever to cutoff, the fuel tank selector to off, and put the electrical gang bar down to secure the airplane's electrical system. He elected to retract the landing gear in an effort to shorten the landing distance. The right front seat occupant reported that the airplane was landed in a southerly direction in the northbound lanes of the Florida Turnpike. There were no ground injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was manufactured in 2008, by EADS Socata as model TBM 700, and was designated serial number 441. At the time of the accident, it was powered by a 850 horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D engine and equipped with a Hartzell HC-E4N-3/E9083 propeller with reverse capability.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane's fuel system consists of a 150.5 gallon capacity wet wing fuel tank in each wing, with a resulting total usable capacity of 292 gallons. Fuel gauging is a capacitance type with 3 probes installed in each wing, and a low fuel sensor installed in each wing inboard of the inboard fuel probe, which provides a low level CAS messages when the fuel quantity remaining in the concerned tank is under about 9 U.S. gallons. The fuel probes are capacitors connected in parallel via electrical harness to the fuel amplifier (FCU) which in turn is connected electrically to the G1000 in the cockpit for display for the fuel tank readings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the maintenance records revealed an entry on August 4, 2010, indicating, \"Troubleshoot right fuel quantity, found pin B at P61 connector loose, removed and replaced pin B at P61 connected as required, performed an operational check of right fuel quantity, system operates normal.\" The airplane total time at that time was recorded to be 451.1 hours. There was no other record of repair of the right fuel harness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 29, 2011, the airplane was flown to HWO for compliance with an annual/600-Hour inspection. A pre-inspection engine run-up was performed and according to a fuel timeline provided by the maintenance facility, the reading for the fuel level in the right fuel tank at the completion of the run was recorded by the G1000 to be 41 gallons. On October 4, 2011, due to fuel leaking from 2 panels of the right wing, it was drained of fuel. A total of about 70 gallons of fuel were drained from the right fuel tank. The same day, electrical power was applied for about 43 seconds and during this time the right fuel quantity at the beginning and ending of the power-up was recorded to be approximately 11 gallons, though there was no remaining fuel in the fuel tank. The leaking panels were removed, repaired, and reinstalled. On October 5th, the fuel drained from the right tank were placed back into the right wing, and a post maintenance run-up was performed using only fuel from the right fuel tank. This was done in an effort to balance the fuel load. The G1000 recorded that at the completion of the engine run, the right fuel tank contained 51 gallons. The G1000 indicated power application 2 days later indicating the right fuel tank had approximately 143 gallons, despite the fact that it had not been fueled. Five days later, on October 12, 2011, the G1000 indicated power application for less than 30 seconds which indicated the right fuel tank had 107 gallons of fuel, while the left fuel tank had 35.5 gallons of fuel. No maintenance was done to evaluate the reason for the changing right fuel quantity.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther review of the maintenance records revealed that the airplane was last inspected in accordance with a 600 hour inspection and annual inspection which was signed off as being completed the day before. The airplane total time at that time was recorded to be 593.4, while the airplane total time at the time of the accident was 595.2 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 Integrated Flight Deck, which is a collection of multiple avionics units which include flight displays. Each display has two SD card slots. The SD memory card was removed from the MFD and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Division for readout.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the NTSB Factual Report, the data was extracted normally and contained 59 log files. The event flight was recorded and contained approximately 1 hour and 38 minutes of data; the calculated sample time interval was 1.055 seconds per data record. A review of the recorded data with respect to the fuel level revealed that beginning about 1218, or about 2 minutes after takeoff until 1229, during which time the airplane was at FL190 and climbing to FL280, the fuel level indication for the left steadily decreased consistent with supplying fuel to the engine, while the fuel level indication for right varied with increases noted. The left fuel level remained steady from about 1229 until about 1245, indicative of fuel being provided from the right fuel tank. From about 1245 until about 1324, a steady decrease of the left fuel quantity was noted, while during the same period the right fuel quantity indication showed a general decline. At the end of the recorded data, the left fuel quantity was approximately 62 gallons, while the right fuel quantity was approximately 60 gallons. A copy of the report and data is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB did not immediately respond to the accident site; however, the NTSB did view the airplane during the recovery process. The approximate location of where the airplane came to rest was reported to be 25 degrees 59.845 minutes North latitude and 080 degrees 13.312 minutes West longitude, or approximately 4,338 feet and 94 degrees from the approach end of runway 27L (intended runway). The airplane was recovered for further examination. According to the recovery crew, fuel leakage was noted at the accident site; however, it was not determined what tank(s) the fuel leaked from, nor the amount of fuel leaked. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was formally inspected by NTSB on October 17 and 18, 2011. Also in attendance were representatives of the FAA, technical advisor from Daher-Socata, and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. As first viewed, both wings and the horizontal stabilizer were removed. The fuselage was fractured circumferentially at frame 8.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cockpit revealed the auxiliary fuel boost pump switch was in the \"Auto\" position, the manual fuel tank selector was in the \"Off\" position, and the fuel selector switch on the overhead panel was in the \"Manual\" position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTesting of the airplane's fuel quantity indicating system was performed using the aircraft's battery for electrical power. The right wing which was empty of fuel was electrically connected while the wing was inverted. With the aircraft's battery power applied, the G1000 displayed red X's for fuel quantity for both sides. The G1000 indicated that the fuel used was 88 gallons, and the fuel remaining was 123 gallons. The left wing which was empty of fuel was then electrically connected in an upright position and with the aircraft's battery power applied, the G1000 displayed 108 gallons in the left wing on initial power up. The gallons decreased steadily over the next 10 minutes to 29 gallons when the test was terminated. The left and right wings were electrically connected in an upright position, and with aircraft's battery power applied, the G1000 displayed 33 gallons for the left fuel tank and the right fuel tank indicated red X's. With battery power applied and fuel selector switch on overhead panel in auto position, the G1000 displayed changing of the fuel selector position. The fuel sequencer was not in bypass; approximately 2 ounces of fuel were drained from the fuel sequence reservoir, which contained slight aluminum particles on the screen. With battery power applied, a fuel supply plumbed to the left wing root, and the fuel selector positioned to the left tank, fuel flow noted at the firewall fitting and no suction was noted at the right wing root fitting. With battery power applied, a fuel supply plumbed to the right wing root, and the fuel selector positioned to the right tank, fuel flow noted at the firewall fitting and no suction was noted at the left wing root fitting. The fuel amplifier was retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the left wing following fuel system testing revealed the fuel tank was breached, but there were no obstructions inside the fuel tank. The fuel tank outlet finger screen had a little fuzz material present. Both flapper valves were installed and noted to operate normally. The low fuel sensor, fuel probes, and electrical harnesses pertaining to fuel were noted to be installed correctly. The low fuel sensor, inner fuel probe, intermediate fuel probe, outer fuel probe, main fuel tank electrical harness, intermediate strap electrical harness, high and low fuel vent valves, and fuel check valve were removed for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the right wing following fuel system testing revealed the fuel tank was breached, but there were no obstructions inside the fuel tank. The fuel tank outlet finger screen had some debris. Both flapper valves were installed and operate normally. The low fuel sensor, fuel probes, and electrical harnesses pertaining to fuel were noted to be installed correctly. The low fuel sensor, inner fuel probe, intermediate fuel probe, outer fuel probe, main fuel tank electrical harness, intermediate strap electrical harness, high and low fuel vent valves, and fuel check valve were removed for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCursory examination of the engine and propeller revealed all four propeller blades were bent aft. Rotation of the propeller by hand resulted in expected rotation of the power turbine assembly, while rotation of the compressor assembly resulted in expected rotation of all the Accessory Gearbox (AGB) drives. Examination of the fuel filter revealed the level of residual fuel in the bowl measured 0.400 inch. The propeller was removed from the engine which was removed from the airframe and shipped to Pratt &amp; Whitney Engine Services (PWES) facility for engine operational testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to operational testing of the engine with FAA oversight, borescope examination of it revealed no discrepancies. The engine was placed in a test cell as received and with FAA oversight, the engine was started and operated at various power settings for over 2.5 hours. Four parameters exceeded the Overhaul Manual tolerances for a zero time engine , but when the repair limits that factor in the engine's operating time were used, the only parameter out of tolerance was the inter turbine temperature (ITT), which can be adjusted with a trim class change. A copy of the report from the engine manufacturer is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the maintenance manual, a low level test, and indicator calibration on aircraft are not due until 1,500 hours and/or 4 years; therefore, these special inspection items were not performed during the last 600-Hour/Annual inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to section 3.8 of the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), in the event of annunciation of \"Fuel Low R\" as reported by the pilot occurring twice, the emergency procedures specify to check the corresponding gauge, check that the other tank has been automatically selected, and if not, place the fuel selector switch to manual and manually select the opposite tank of the indication. Section 3.8 of the POH also indicates that with respect to the red warning CAS message \"Fuel Press\" on, a fuel pressure drop at the high pressure engine pump inlet. The corrective action indicates to check the remaining fuel, move the fuel selector to the opposite tank, check the fuel pressure indication, and place the \"Aux BP\" fuel switch to the auto position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe POH also indicates that the fuel selector automatically changes in-flight every 10 minutes, and the maximum dissymmetry is 15 U.S. gallons. When the first low level CAS message occurs, the sequencer immediately selects the other tank. The selected tank will operate until the second low level CAS message occurs. When both low level CAS messages are visible, the sequencer changes tanks every 1 minute 15 seconds. There are no procedures specified in the POH to deal with multiple conflicting fuel level annunciations from the same fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTesting of the 3 capacitance fuel probes from each wing, the low fuel sensor from each wing, the fuel amplifier (FCU), the fuel check valves from each wing, the left fuel gauge harness and intermediate strap, the right fuel gauge harness and right intermediate strap were performed at the respective manufacturer's facility with oversight from personnel of Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA), Bourget, France. The results of the examinations revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the right fuel gauge harness, part number (P/N) T700G921201000100, serial number (S/N) 0110740 was performed at the manufacturer's facility BEA oversight, who also performed X-ray testing of the harness. An electrical continuity check revealed a discrepancy of pin B of the P60 and P61 harnesses. During the testing resistance values of several thousand Ohms were noted; however, during movement of the harness, the resistance value increased to more than 1 Million Ohms. Both harnesses were examined with an x-ray machine, the results of which were compared with the left harness, as well as to an exemplar harness. It was noted that the High Impedance shielded cable near the P60 connector appeared to be outside of the solder joint. The shielded wire on the P60 and P61 sides is a copper nickelled (kapton type) with a self-soldering sleeve adapted to this technology. A complete disassembly of the P60 harness was then performed which revealed that when the self-soldering sleeve was cut, the shielded HI wire was not correctly soldered to the shielding braid near the P60 connector during manufacturing; it was not complete. Testing of an exemplar harness duplicating the improper solder connection of the right harness was performed on an exemplar airplane with no fuel. During the testing, the right fuel quantity depicted the maximum value.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPersonnel from the BEA reported that during research, starting with airplane serial number 434, new kapton type electrical wires were utilized for some of the fuel gauge harnesses. And although the manufacturing instructions were clear, one mistake was identified in the manufacturing process.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost-Accident Corrective Actions&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of the initial finding of the investigation and the result of a second airplane with erroneous fuel indication issue, in October 2011, a representative of the airplane manufacturer sent an e-mail to all owners, operators, and network owners of TBM 700 and TBM 850 (market name for TBM 700) airplanes equipped with Garmin G1000 Integrated Flight Deck. The e-mail advised of 2 instances in which erroneous fuel indication occurred. The e-mail asked that before the next flight, document the quantity of fuel in each tank, and then fill each tank noting the amount. If a discrepancy exists, contact a maintenance center to correct the discrepancy. The issue involving the other airplane was attributed to be from an intermediate fuel probe.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, in March 2013, the airplane manufacturer developed technical note (TN) 70-014, titled Fuel Gauge Harness. This made it mandatory to replace the shielded cable on TBM 700 airplanes equipped with modification (MOD) MOD70-0176-00, affected airplanes were S/N's 434 through 440, and 442 through 450. The airplane manufacturer also changed their quality control procedure for fuel gauge harnesses for production airplanes, and implemented a specific box used for manufacturing fuel gauge harnesses. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During cruise flight, the pilot reported to an air traffic controller that the airplane was having engine fuel pressure problems. The controller advised the pilot of available airports for landing if necessary and asked the pilot's intentions. The pilot chose to continue the flight. GPS data recorded by an onboard avionics system indicated that the engine had momentarily lost total power about 20 seconds before the pilot reported a problem to the controller. About 7 minutes later, when the airplane was about 7,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost total power again, and power was not restored for the remainder of the flight. The pilot attempted to glide to an airport about 10 miles away, but the airplane crashed in a field about 3 miles from the airport. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS data showed a loss of fuel pressure before each of the engine power losses and prolonged lateral g-forces consistent with a side-slip flight condition. The rudder trim tab was found displaced to the left about 3/8 inch. Flight testing and recorded flight data revealed that the rudder trim tab displacement was consistent with that required to achieve no side slip during a typical climb segment. The GPS and flight data indicated that the lateral g-forces increased as the airplane leveled off and accelerated, indicating that the automatic rudder trim feature of the yaw damper system was either not engaged or not operating. The recorded data indicated autopilot system engagement, which should have automatically engaged the yaw damper system. However, the data indicated the yaw damper was not engaged; the yaw damper could have subsequently been turned off by several means not recorded by the avionics system. Testing of the manual electric rudder (yaw) trim system revealed no anomalies, indicating that the pilot would have still been able to trim the airplane using the manual system. It is likely that the pilot's failure to properly trim the airplane's rudder led to a prolonged uncoordinated flight condition. Although the fuel tank system is designed to prevent unporting of the fuel lines during momentary periods of uncoordinated flight, it is not intended to do so for extended periods of uncoordinated flight. Therefore, the fuel tank feed line likely unported during the prolonged uncoordinated flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of fuel pressure and engine power.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller and propeller controls were not in the feathered position, thus the windmilling propeller would have increased the airplane's descent rate during the glide portion of the flight. The glide airspeed used by the pilot was 20 knots below the airspeed recommended by the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), and the reduced airspeed also would have increased the airplane's descent rate during the glide. The flight and GPS data indicated that the airplane had a gliding range of about 16 nautical miles from the altitude where the final loss of engine power occurred; however, the glide performance was dependent on several factors, including feathering the propeller and maintaining the proper airspeed, neither of which the pilot did. Although the POH did not contain maximum range glide performance data with a windmilling propeller, based on the available information, it is likely that the airplane could have glided to the alternate airport about 10 miles away if the pilot had followed the proper procedures.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn September 5, 2011, about 1833 central daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N850SY, impacted terrain near Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, during a forced landing following a loss of engine power. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Green Plane LLC, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual flight rules (VFR) conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight originated from the Central Wisconsin Airport (CWA), Mosinee, WI, about 1626, and the intended destination was the Waukegan Regional Airport (UGN), Waukegan, Illinois.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS track data, retrieved from the Garmin G1000 avionics system on the airplane, depicted the airplane departing CWA about 1626. The airplane remained in the CWA traffic pattern, performing two full stop landings at CWA prior to proceeding toward UGN. At 1653, the airplane took off from runway 8 at CWA and then proceeded southeast for about 5 nautical miles then south for 12 nautical miles where it crossed the Stevens Point Airport (STE) at an altitude of about 12,000 feet mean sea level (msl). After crossing STE, the airplane turned southeast to a heading of 130 degrees. During this portion of the flight, the airplane was in a climb reaching an altitude of about 19,000 feet msl at 1703:15. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData retrieved from the G1000 indicated that during the climb portion of the flight the roll angle and lateral acceleration were neutral. This indicated that the rudder trim was appropriately set for the climb portion of the flight. As the airplane leveled off and accelerated from the 140 knot indicated airspeed (IAS) for the climb to 200 knots IAS in level flight, the lateral acceleration steadily increased reaching values in excess of 0.15 g (positive values indicate a right sideslip), and the roll angle decreased to values less than -5 (positive values indicate a right roll), corresponding to a left bank in excess of 5 degrees angle of bank. The lateral acceleration remained elevated throughout the remainder of the flight. This and the recorded roll angles indicated that the airplane was flying in a slip. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1811:30, the airplane began a descent from 19,000 feet msl and the IAS increased to about 225 knots. As the speed increased, the lateral acceleration increased to about 0.2g. At 1822:33, when the airplane was at 11,000 feet msl and about 7 nautical miles north of the Timmerman Airport (MWC), the avionics system recorded a momentary complete loss of engine torque. At this time the pilot was in communication with the General Mitchell International Airport (MKE) West Departure control position. At 1822:53, the pilot informed the controller that he had a problem with the airplane, later reporting that the problem was related to fuel pressure. The controller advised the pilot of three airports available for landing if necessary, and noted that the airplane had descended 1,600 feet below its assigned altitude of 11,000 feet msl. When the controller inquired as to the pilot's intentions, the pilot elected to continue the flight to UGN. The controller subsequently cleared the flight to 8,000 feet msl and the airplane maintained that altitude for approximately 3 minutes. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1829:29, the avionics system recorded another complete loss of engine torque and the pilot reported the loss of power to the controller. Engine power was not restored for the remainder of the flight. At the time of the power loss, the airplane was about 10 miles west of the John H. Batten Airport (RAC), Racine, Wisconsin, at about 7,600 feet msl. The field elevation of RAC was 674 feet msl. At the time of the loss of engine power, the airplane was about 9.25 nautical miles west of RAC. GPS data showed that the airplane turned toward RAC and communications transcripts verified that the pilot was attempting to glide the airplane to RAC for a forced landing. The airplane descended at about 100 knots IAS toward RAC. The accident site and last recorded GPS position were about 3 miles southwest of the approach end of runway 4 at RAC. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with single-engine land airplane and instrument-airplane ratings. He was issued a third-class airman medical certificate, with a restriction for corrective lenses, on April 28, 2011.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had logged about 2,075 hours total flight time, with approximately 165 hours flight time in the accident airplane. The pilot's logbook included an endorsement dated February 5, 2011, that indicated the completion of a flight review as required by 14 CFR 61.56.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLogbook and training records indicated that the pilot had received type specific training for the accident airplane from SimCom Training Centers, Orlando, Florida, in August of 2010, and from Turbine Solutions, Inc., St Cloud, Florida, in February of 2011. A review of the training records from Turbine Solutions indicated that the pilot had average knowledge of the airplane systems and procedures. The training record noted that the instructor discussed with the pilot the possibility of stepping down to a less complex airplane or having another pilot accompany on long cross country flights. The pilot completed the recurrent training at Turbine Solutions and was issued a completion certificate on February 5, 2011.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe accident airplane was a Socata model TBM 700N, serial number 546. It was a single engine low-wing monoplane of mainly aluminum construction. It had a retractable tricycle landing gear and was configured to seat six occupants. The airplane was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D engine, serial number RV0210, rated to produce 850 shaft-horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe and engine had accumulated 217.8 hours total time in-service at the time of the accident. The most recent annual inspection was completed on July 28, 2011, at 201.9 hours airframe time. According to maintenance records, the most recent maintenance action was accomplished on August 9, 2011 at 211.6 airframe hours, and involved troubleshooting for a flap problem. There were no subsequent entries in the maintenance logbook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nWeather conditions recorded by the RAC Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), located about 3 miles northeast of the accident site, at 1853, were: wind from 10 degrees at 11 knots gusting to 19 knots, visibility 10 miles, scattered clouds at 3,600 feet agl, temperature 14 degrees Celsius, dew point 7 degrees Celsius, and altimeter 30.15 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest on a flat farm field facing east and the initial impact point was about 130 feet south of the main wreckage. The initial impact point was located on the north side of a road ditch on the north side of a highway. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was fractured at a position near the aft edge of the entry door. The tail surfaces including the elevators, horizontal stabilizers, rudder, and vertical stabilizer, remained attached to the aft fuselage. No damage was evident on the tail surfaces. The elevator trim tabs appeared to be in a neutral position and were aligned with the elevator. The rudder trim tab was displaced tab left about 10 mm (3/8\"). The forward fuselage was predominately intact with crushing of the lower fuselage and buckling of the fuselage skins. The engine remained attached to the fuselage and there was bending of the firewall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth wings remained partially attached to the fuselage. The wings remained predominately intact with crushing of portions of the leading edge. The left flap was separated at about half span. The outboard portion of that flap was located between the initial impact point and the main wreckage. The inboard portion of the flap remained attached to the wing. The left aileron remained attached to the wing by its outboard hinge. The right aileron remained attached to the wing by its outboard hinge. The right flap remained attached to the wing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree propeller blades exhibited rearward bending with some chordwise scratching/abrasion of the leading edge of the blades. The fourth blade exhibited twisting of the blade toward low pitch and chordwise abrasion/scratching of the leading edge of the blade. The propeller blades were not in a feathered position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was an odor at the accident site consistent with aviation jet fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDocumentation of the various cockpit controls and switches was performed with the following findings:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPower Lever – forward&#x0D;\nPropeller lever – forward&#x0D;\nCondition lever – Forward&#x0D;\nManual Override – Aft&#x0D;\nFlap Lever – Forward (up)&#x0D;\nFuel Selector – Left tank&#x0D;\nLanding Gear – Up&#x0D;\nEngine Starter – Off&#x0D;\nEngine Ignition – Auto&#x0D;\nAuxiliary Boost Pump – Auto&#x0D;\nFuel Selector – Manual&#x0D;\nElectrical Power Crash lever – Down&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the on-scene examination, the airplane was transported to an enclosed facility for further examination. During this examination, the wing fuel tank inboard access panels were removed and the inside of the fuel tanks examined. The interior of the tanks were clean. The fuel strainers at the fuel pickup were clean. The one-way valves located on the outboard rib of the inboard fuel bay were checked. The valves appeared clean and moved freely. No obstruction of the valves was found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 avionics system with data recording capabilities. The data card was located and recovered after removal of the unit's bezel. The contents of the data card were downloaded for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane's engine was removed and inserted into a shipping container for examination at the manufacturer's facility. The subsequent examination consisted of disassembly of the engine and disassembly and/or functional testing of the fuel pump, fuel control unit, propeller speed governor, flow divider valve, compressor bleed valve, fuel/oil heat exchanger, solenoid valve, torque limiter, fuel nozzles, and overspeed governor. The examination revealed no anomalies with regard to the engine or accessories that would have prevented engine operation. Some test parameters were not within new factory specifications but would not have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office, Waukesha, Wisconsin, on September 7, 2011. The pilot's death was attributed to injuries received in the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing was performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Testing results listed the following substances:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&gt;&gt; Rosuvastatin detected in Urine&#x0D;\n&gt;&gt; Rosuvastatin NOT detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\n&gt;&gt; 11.61 (ug/mL, ug/g) Theophylline detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\n&gt;&gt; 62.3 (ug/mL, ug/g) Theophylline detected in Urine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe airplane had integral fuel tanks formed by sealing of the structure in each wing. Each tank was divided into an inboard (feeder) area and an outboard (storage) area. The feeder section of each fuel tank was formed by the root rib and the second rib outboard from the root. This rib contained one-way valves that would allow fuel to flow from the outboard storage area into the inboard feeder area, but prevent fuel from flowing outboard. The one way valves in the feeder section were intended to prevent unporting of the fuel tank pickup due to momentary periods of uncoordinated flight as would be encountered during turbulence, but were not intended to do so for extended periods of uncoordinated flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of flight data indicated that the airplane was initially operated with the fuel selection in the automatic mode as evidenced by the changes in the fuel levels during ground operation. During this period, the fuel quantity of one tank would reduce for a period of about 75 seconds while the level in the other tank remained constant. After the 75 second period, the roles would reverse. This characteristic is consistent with the description of automatic fuel sequencer operation described in the Pilot's Operating Handbook Manual (POH). The POH stated that during flight, the interval would change from 75 seconds for ground operation to 10 minutes for in-flight operation. The sensitivity of the fuel level readings in flight precluded making a positive determination of the fuel selection mode during flight, however, during postaccident examination of the airplane, the fuel mode selector switch was found in the manual position and the fuel selector valve was positioned on the left tank. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach wing tank contained a low fuel detector that senses when the level in an individual fuel tank reaches 9.1 gallons of usable fuel remaining. The POH stated that once reaching 9.1 gallons remaining in a tank, a low fuel level alert would be displayed on the crew alerting system (CAS), and if the fuel selection mode was set for automatic operation, the fuel sequencer would automatically select the opposite tank and remain on that tank until its level also reached 9.1 gallons usable fuel remaining, at which point the sequencer would switch tanks every 75 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe auxiliary electric fuel boost pump system in the airplane was controlled by the \"AUX BP\" switch on the fuel panel and allowed the pilot to select one of two operating modes, \"ON\", and \"AUTO\". In automatic mode the system was designed to automatically activate the electric pump if a drop in fuel pressure was detected at the mechanical fuel pump outlet. Once activated, the auxiliary boost pump would continue to run for the remainder of the flight unless turned off by the pilot. During postaccident examination, the \"AUX BP\" switch was found in the \"AUTO\" position. Review of the recorded data from the G1000 showed that fuel pressure prior to the first loss of engine torque was about 16 psi. A few seconds prior to the first loss of engine torque, the fuel pressure began to decrease followed by a decrease in fuel flow and engine torque. This was then followed by an increase in fuel pressure and restoration of engine torque. The recorded fuel pressure once engine torque was restored was about 36 psi, which indicated that the auxiliary electric boost pump had activated. Fuel pressure readings remained about 36 psi for approximately 6 minutes and 15 seconds when the pressure dropped to below 5 psi. This drop in pressure coincided with the second loss of engine torque. Although engine torque was not restored, the recorded fuel pressure increased, peaking at 27 psi before leveling off at about 20 psi. Fuel pressure remained about 20 psi or above for the remainder of the flight but engine torque was not restored.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight parameter data, specifically the lateral acceleration and bank angle parameters indicated that after leveling off at cruise altitude, the airplane yawed to the right and banked to the left consistent with a side-slip. The airplane was in a slip condition for a period of about 19 minutes prior to the first loss of engine torque. During this period the average lateral acceleration was 0.14 G, and the average bank angle was 8 degrees left bank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInformation provided by the airplane manufacturer indicated that the airplane's fuel tank was delineated by the front spar and the leading edge spar from rib N1 to rib N7, then by the rear spar and the leading edge spar from rib N7 to rib N18. The inboard collector tank was delineated between ribs N1 and N3.The fuel capacity of the feeder section of the tank was about 33 liters or about 8.7 gallons. Just prior to the first loss of engine torque, the fuel flow was about 57 gallons per hour, and prior to the second loss of torque the fuel flow was about 50 gallons per hour. The fuel tank was equipped with three capacitance type sending units in each wing. According to the manufacturer, the fuel quantity indication was unreliable given the lateral acceleration that was present during the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with an automatic flight control system (AFCS) that included an autopilot and yaw damper. The autopilot controlled the aircraft pitch and roll attitudes following commands received from the flight director. The yaw damper system operated independent of autopilot and was designed to monitor lateral acceleration to achieve coordinated flight. The system was also designed to automatically actuate the rudder trim to achieve trimmed flight. The automatic trim feature was only enabled when the yaw damper system was engaged. The rudder trim system also included a manual electric yaw trim (MEYT) switch on the pilot yoke that enabled the pilot to trim the rudder without yaw damper engagement. The yaw damper system could be enabled independent of the autopilot by depressing the \"YD\" button. In addition, if the pilot selected the \"AP\" key, the autopilot, yaw damper and flight director would be activated simultaneously. The yaw damper system could be disengaged by activating the MEYT switch located on the yoke, or by depressing the \"YD\" button. The parameters recorded by the G1000 avionics system did not include a discrete parameter indicating yaw damper engagement or trim motor actuation. Based on the recorded data, the lateral acceleration corresponded with the airplane's airspeed during the entire flight, including the two takeoffs and landings at CWA, meaning that as the airspeed increased, so did the lateral acceleration. This behavior is consistent with an out of trim condition. Functional testing of the rudder trim motor and the digital/analog converter interface for the trim motor was performed using an exemplar airplane. No anomalous operation was noted during the test. Further functional testing of the MEYT, rudder trim motor, and digital/analog converter interface, was accomplished on the accident airplane and no anomalous behavior was noted. Comprehensive functional testing of the yaw damper system was not performed, however, an electrical performance test revealed no anomalies and confirmed the proper functioning of the MEYT from the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn exemplar airplane was used to perform a short test flight. Prior to the test flight, the rudder trim indicator reading to achieve 10mm of tab left deflection was noted. During the flight at a normal cruise power setting, the MEYT was activated resulting in the disengagement of the yaw damper system as expected. The MEYT was actuated to achieve 10mm of left rudder trim tab deflection. This resulted in a right yaw and left bank in order to achieve a constant heading. This test was performed twice during the flight before returning to the airport. Download of the flight data from the exemplar airplane was compared to the flight data from the accident flight. The lateral g-force and bank angles recorded during the test flight were consistent with the data recorded during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe emergency procedures section of the POH denoted the following procedure in the event of an engine failure:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1 -- If AP engaged : \"AP / TRIM DISC INT\" push--button . . .PRESSED&#x0D;\n2 -- Power lever . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The POH did not contain maximum range glide performance data with a windmilling propeller. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that he flew an instrument approach and was clear of clouds about 650 feet above ground level when he proceeded visually to the airport. About 1/2 mile from the runway, he thought the airplane was too high, but a few seconds later the airplane felt like it had an excessive rate of descent. His attempts to arrest the rate of descent were unsuccessful, and the left main landing gear struck the ground about 120 feet prior to the runway threshold. The recorded data downloaded from the airplane's non-volatile memory showed that the airplane's airspeed varied from about 71 - 81 knots indicated airspeed (IAS) during the 10 seconds prior to ground impact. The data also indicated that there was about a 3 - 5 knot tailwind during the final landing approach. The airplane's stall speed with the airplane in the landing configuration with landing flaps was 64 knots IAS at maximum gross weight. The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction or system failure of the airplane.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 19, 2011, at 0843 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM-850, N1UL, sustained substantial damage when the airplane impacted the terrain about 120 feet prior to the approach end of runway 10L (3,404 feet by 50 feet, asphalt) at the Salem Airpark (38D), Salem, Ohio. The private pilot and two passengers were not injured, but a third passenger received serious injuries. The airplane was registered to Urschel Air Leasing, LLC, and operated by Urschel Laboratories, Inc., as a business flight under the provisions of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed. The flight departed the Porter County Regional Airport (VPZ), Valparaiso, Indiana, at 0722. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that Akron Approach Control cleared the flight to fly the GPS-A instrument approach to 38D. At GEOFF, the final approach fix, the airplane was level at 3,000 feet above mean sea level (msl). The pilot lowered the landing gear and the flaps to begin the descent. The airplane broke out of the clouds about 1,800 feet msl and the pilot proceeded visually to the airport. He circled to the right in order to make a landing on runway 10. The pilot reported that the winds were a direct crosswind from 190 degrees at 10 knots. He reported that he had calculated that the landing distance would be 1,400 feet, and he intended to land near the approach end of the runway. He turned onto the final leg about 2 miles from the airport while maintaining about 85 - 90 knots indicated airspeed (IAS) on the approach with full flaps and descending about 400 feet per minute. He reported that about 1/2 mile from the runway, he thought the airplane was too high, but \"a few seconds later\" the airplane felt like it \"literally just dropped out of the sky.\" He immediately applied full power and pitched the nose up to perform a go-around, but \"the application of power was too late\" and the left main landing gear struck the ground about 120 feet prior to the runway threshold. The airplane came to a stop about 120 feet past the runway threshold on the left side of the runway.    &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin GPS 1000 MFD (multi-function display) flash card, which recorded the airplane's performance and waypoint data, was downloaded. The recorded data indicated that the airplane's airspeed varied from about 71 - 81 knots IAS during the 10 seconds prior to ground impact. The data also indicated that the airplane's ground speed averaged about 3 - 5 knots higher than the IAS during the final approach. The Socata TBM-850 Pilot Operating Handbook indicates that the stall speed with the airplane in the landing configuration with landing flaps was 64 knots IAS at maximum gross weight.     &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot indicated in his report to the National Transportation Safety Board that there was no mechanical malfunction or system failure of the airplane. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During the takeoff initial climb, the pilot reported that the rudder trim became deflected to the left and remained stuck in that position. He stopped the climb, cycled the autopilot, and turned off the yaw damper; however, his efforts did not resolve the rudder trim deflection issue. The pilot input rudder in an attempt to correct the issue, and he thought that the airplane was under control, so he continued the flight to his destination. The avionics failed shortly thereafter, followed by the illumination of the low fuel pressure light. Then the engine lost power. The pilot feathered the propeller and was able to reach an airport for an emergency landing. During the landing, the airplane floated down the runway, touching down about midfield. The pilot was not able to stop the airplane before it exited the runway and collided with terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident, the rudder trim tab was found deflected two inches to the left. However, the rudder trim indicator showed a full deflection to the right. The circuit breaker was found partially open and was recycled, as indicated in the pilot’s operating handbook for rudder trim emergencies, and the anomaly could not be replicated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination also found 90 gallons of fuel in the right tank and no fuel in the left tank. However, this airplane is equipped with a fuel autobalance system, which should have selected fuel to be fed from the right tank with the left tank empty. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined during postaccident testing and examination.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 23, 2010, about 1600 Pacific daylight time, a Socata TBM-700, N750AB, lost engine power during cruise flight, and the pilot made an emergency landing on runway 33 at the Lost Hills – Kern County Airport (L84), Lost Hills, California. The airplane overran the runway and the nose landing gear was sheared off. The airplane came to rest on its nose. The owner operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. The pilot/owner and four passengers were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed San Luis Obispo Airport (SBP), San Luis Obispo, California, about 1530, with a planned destination of Fresno-Yosemite Airport (FAT), Fresno, California. No flight plan had been filed; however, the pilot had been receiving flight-following.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was interviewed by a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator. He stated that earlier on the day of the incident he had topped off with fuel before departing FAT; total fuel on board the airplane was 282 gallons. He and his family landed at SBP about 1100, went to lunch, and visited a local university campus. They returned to the airport for the return flight to SBP. In preparation for takeoff, he set the flaps to 10 degrees, and set the aileron and rudder trim for a normal takeoff. The takeoff was normal and the pilot stated that after takeoff, his intent was to climb the airplane to an altitude of 13,500 feet. However, during the climb, he reported that the rudder deflected all the way to the left, and he discontinued the climb. He maintained an altitude of 9,500 feet, and started to troubleshoot the problem; which included turning off the yaw dampener and manually flying the airplane. He also cycled the auto pilot, but the issue was not resolved. The pilot reported that Oakland Air Traffic Control Center (OAK ATCT) controllers asked him if he needed assistance, which he initially declined. The pilot stated that he initiated a climb to his original altitude of 13,500 feet. He reported that during the climb, the airplane’s avionics failed, including the global positioning system (GPS), followed by a loss of engine power and illumination of the low fuel pressure light. The pilot further stated that the low fuel pressure light was illuminated for the left fuel tank. He radioed OAK ATCT and requested vectors to the nearest airport. The pilot stated that during landing, with full flaps, the airplane “floated” down the runway. After touchdown, he applied the brakes; however, the airplane continued off the runway and struck debris, shearing off the nose landing gear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s written statement, the rudder became stuck about 5 minutes out of SBP. The full left rudder deflection caused the airplane to turn to the right. He turned off the auto pilot and flew the airplane manually, utilizing the rudder pedals to compensate. He contacted OAK ATCT, and was asked if he needed assistance, as they had noted that he was having problems keeping the airplane straight. The pilot stated that he thought he had the airplane under control and would continue toward FAT. The pilot added that during the initial contact with OAK ATCT, they were not able to read his transponder, and he was asked to recycle it. He complied with the request, and simultaneously lost both of the GARMINS (Garmin 530 and Garmin 430), the red and yellow warning lights came on, and the engine stopped running. The pilot stated that he noted that the red light illuminated indicating low fuel. He asked for vectors to the nearest airport, and then feathered the propeller, while trying to restart the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubsequent to the accident, the pilot reported to representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that after departure and passing through 9,500 feet, he noticed that the slip/skid indication on the pilot’s flight display indicated a full right deflection. The pilot confirmed this from the rudder deflection indicator located on the pedestal. He turned off the auto pilot and yaw damper systems and was able to gain better control of the airplane; however, the airplane remained in a right turn. After the airplane lost engine power, the pilot feathered the propeller to provide a better glide ratio. He declared an emergency with air traffic control (ATC) and asked for vectors to the nearest airport. He informed ATC that he did not have any indications of navigation since both Garmin’s, the GNS430 and 530, had both temporarily lost power and were rebooting. The pilot continued to the accident airport and made a left base approach for runway 33. The airplane landed midfield and rolled off the end of the runway about 300 feet causing the nose landing gear to shear off and damaging the left wing and fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRetrieval personnel noted that the airplane had come to rest in a nose-down attitude. Both wings remained attached to the fuselage. The left flap was extended with no apparent damage to the left aileron and flap. No fuel was recovered from the left fuel tank. The right wing contained about 90 gallons of fuel. The bottom of the fuselage sustained substantial damage. Two of the four propeller blades were folded underneath the nose of the airplane, but the propeller assembly remained attached to the drive flange. Inside the cockpit, retrieval personnel visually noted that all of the circuit breakers were pushed in (closed). They also noted that the fuel sequencer was selected to AUTO. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to recovery of the airplane with an airframe representative, a functional check of the rudder trim and fuel control unit (FCU) was performed. When maintenance personnel turned on the avionics master and autopilot switches, the autopilot tested normally. They noted that the rudder trim indicator showed a full deflection to the right. The rudder trim switch was then activated in the direction to return the rudder trim to the neutral position. Maintenance personnel reported that the rudder trim switch did not move the rudder trim indicator nor was there any noise of a trim motor running. Utilizing the pilot’s operating handbook chapter 3.13 titled EMERGENCY SECTION – RUNWAY TRIMS, it directs the pilot to pull the circuit breaker (CB). As maintenance personnel went to pull the rudder trim CB, he noted that it was already partially out. He then recycled the rudder trim CB and performed the test again with no anomalies noted. Maintenance personnel also reported that the autopilot was retested with no issues, and there were no other avionics failures. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA functional test of fuel delivery to the engine was performed. The fuel line was opened up just past the auxiliary pump. The pump was turned on, and fuel was observed to flow through the pump. The fuel line was reconnected and the procedure was performed again but this time to the FCU. Maintenance personnel reported that there was no fuel flow restriction to the FCU, and the pressure differential indicator (PDI) on the fuel filter was extended. An examination of the fuel filter revealed that the fuel bypass indicator had popped.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual inspection of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical problems. On June 24, 2010, the engine was inspected by a representative from Pratt and Whitney under the auspices of the NTSB, in Madera, California. During the recovery it was noted that the airframe in-line fuel filter bowl and impending bypass indicator was extended. Visual inspection of the engine revealed no mechanical anomalies; all connections and fittings were intact and secured. The compressor and power turbine inlet areas were inspected; they were found to be intact with no evidence of blade rub or blade shift. A more detailed report is attached to the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe was inspected on July 21, 2010, by the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) and a representative from Daher-Socata. There were no mechanical anomalies found during the airframe inspection. It was noted in the pilot’s statement that during the rudder trim failure, the airplane was flying in a dissymmetric condition (crabbing). According to the manufacturer’s representative, fuel starvation in the lower wing would occur if the airplane were in a crab with a roll angle position, which would lead to an engine shutdown. An airframe examination report is attached to the public docket for this accident. Also, the pilot stated that the pilot’s operating handbook failed to state cross-control limitations for fuel starvation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn section 2 titled Limitations of the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH), the total fuel capacity is 290.6 gallons, with a total usable of 281.6 gallons. The manual also stated that there is a maximum fuel imbalance of 25 gallons. In the Normal Procedures section (section 4) of the POH, it states that in spite of the automatic fuel selector, a non-negligible dissymmetry may be observed at the end of a climb, and that the tolerated maximum dissymmetry is 25 gallons. Section 7, Description, of the POH the Tank Automatic Selector, allows fuel to feed from one tank to the other in predetermined sequences, without pilot intervention. When the selector is operated, it controls the time during which the selected fuel tank will operate; the time varies depending on airplane conditions. Normally in flight, it will change every 10 minutes, as long as the left and right low level warning lights are not illuminated. If a low level warning light does illuminate, the sequencer will automatically select the other tank. If the second low level warning light illuminates, the sequencer will change fuel tanks every minute and 15 seconds. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Rudder Trim Actuator was examined by Precilec, under the supervision of the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d ’Analyses (BEA). A Visual examination of the actuator showed no obvious mechanical malfunctions. Precilec personnel noted that it was near the retract position. Functionality tests with and without a load were performed with no fault found, and the actuator was able to retract and extend correctly. It was noted during the acceptance test that two values did not conform to the tolerance limits; however, it did not affect the operation of the actuator. The acceptance test was used to test new actuators off the production line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pitch, roll, and yaw servos were bench tested at Executive AutoPilots, Sacramento, California, under the supervision of a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator. A detailed report is attached to the docket. The inspection revealed that the servos operated normally and no runaway anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pitch trim circuit breaker was submitted to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. Visual examination showed no signs of damage or arcing; it was found to be in the “closed” position. An x-ray of the interior circuit contacts was performed to determine status of position and possible internal damage. The NTSB specialist confirmed that the circuit breaker was in the “closed” position and there was no sign of obvious internal damage. Electrical continuity of the circuit breaker was performed with no discrepancies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe global positioning system (GPS) units were shipped to Washington, D.C., for additional examination and download by the vehicle recorders division of the NTSB. The units were the Garmin GMX-200; Garmin GDU-620, and the Bendix/King KCP-220; there was no accident related data recovered from any of the units. The Garmin GMX-200 is a panel mounted multi-function color display, which displays data from stored data cards inserted into the front panel, including: custom maps, IFR and VFR charts, terrain, traffic information, lighting, weather radar, and Jeppessen Chartview products. This unit only retains configuration data such as user settings, and does not retain ground track or last displayed information such as radar. The Garmin GDU-620 is a panel mounted primary flight/multi-function (PFD/MFD) with two side-by-side color displays. The PFD function displays flight performance data (airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, attitude, and navigation data). The MFD displays stored data from data cards inserted into the front panel, similar to the GMX-200 display. The Bendix/King flight computer performs flight director and autopilot command computations.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the airplane’s airworthiness records revealed that in December 2008, the instrument panel was modified to a -701 pilot panel in accordance with Socata data. On November 26, 2008, the Garmin GMX-200 MFD was installed in accordance with STC# SA01692SE, and a Garmin G600 PFD/MFD was installed in accordance with STC# SA02153LA, with the POH at Revision as per service bulletin 70-120-34 Amdt. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the Garmin manual under Airworthiness Limitations, it says that there are no additional airworthiness limitations as defined in 14 CFR Part 23, Appendix G. G23.4 that result from the modification. It also states that it is FAA approved and specifies maintenance required under Part 43.16 and 91.403 of the Federal Aviation Regulations unless an alternative program has been approved by the FAA. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During the flight, the instrument-rated private pilot was monitoring the weather at his intended destination. He noted the weather and runway conditions and decided to conduct a global-positioning-system instrument approach to a known closed runway with the intention of circling to a different runway. As the airplane neared the missed approach point, the pilot established visual contact with the airport's runway environment and canceled his instrument flight rules clearance. As he entered the left downwind leg of the traffic pattern for his intended runway, the pilot noticed that the first part of the runway was covered in fog and that the visibility was 0.75 of a mile with light snow. With at least 5,000 feet of clear runway, he opted to land just beyond the fog. Prior to touchdown, the pilot concluded that there was not enough runway length left to make a landing and performed a go-around by applying power, pitching up, and retracting the landing gear. During the go-around, the pilot focused outside the airplane cockpit but had no horizon reference in the dark night conditions. He heard the stall warning and realized that the aircraft was not climbing. The pilot pitched the nose down and observed only snow and trees ahead. Not being able to climb over the trees, the airplane subsequently impacted trees and terrain, coming to rest upright in a wooded, snow-covered field. The pilot stated that there were no anomalies with the engine or airframe that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On December 13, 2009, about 1738 Pacific standard time, an EADS Socata TBM-700 airplane, N850MT, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following an aborted landing near the Truckee-Tahoe Airport (TRK), Truckee, California.  The airplane was registered to Tahoe Investments, Los Altos Hills, California, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The instrument-rated private pilot and his passenger received minor injuries.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal flight. The cross-country flight originated from the San Carlos Airport (SQL), San Carlos, California, at 1630, with an intended destination of TRK. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nIn a written statement, the pilot reported that prior to the flight he obtained a weather briefing for the intended route of flight and destination.  He also continuously checked the TRK weather prior to departure. He recalled that prior to departure the TRK weather indicated visibility greater than 7 miles, overcast clouds at 2,000 feet, wind calm, and that runway 19 was closed.  During the flight, he monitored the weather conditions at TRK and decided to conduct the Global Positioning System (GPS) Runway 19 instrument approach with the intention of circling to a different runway. The pilot reported that the passenger saw the airport as they passed over it, but he could not see it and continued IFR flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the pilot initiated the instrument approach, he continued to monitor the weather conditions at the airport and noted that the visibility had decreased to 7 miles. The pilot stated that during the approach he activated all of the airplane’s deicing equipment, as the airplane had “picked up some light rime ice.”  The pilot was unsure at what altitude the airplane broke out of the clouds because the ground was visible throughout the approach.  As the airplane approached the published missed approach point (MAP), the pilot established visual contact with the runway lighting for runway 28 and subsequently canceled his IFR clearance.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the pilot entered a left downwind for runway 28, he noticed “the first part of [runway] 28 was covered in fog.”  The pilot checked the reported weather conditions via the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) located at TRK and noted that the visibility was three-quarters of a mile with light snow. The pilot reported that there was at least 5,000 feet of clear runway and he decided to make a mid-field landing, just beyond the fog. Prior to touchdown the pilot decided that there was not enough runway to land, as the airplane was “too high and fast.”  The pilot initiated a go-around by applying power, pitching up, and retracting the landing gear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the go-around the pilot reported that he “was totally focused outside the plane because of the clouds and mountains, but had no horizon reference in the dark.” He also stated that he heard an audible warning horn, which he thought was activated because he had failed to raise the landing flaps before retracting the gear. As the audible horn warning continued, the pilot observed that the airplane was not climbing; he then realized that the sound was the stall warning horn. The pilot stated that when he pitched the nose down, he immediately saw only snow and trees ahead. Not being able to climb over the trees, the airplane subsequently impacted trees and terrain about 0.5 miles northwest from the departure end of runway 28.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the airplane came to rest upright within a wooded snow covered field.  The left and right wings were structurally damaged.  The propeller assembly was separated from the engine and located adjacent to the main wreckage.  A strong odor of jet fuel was also present at the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that there were no pre-existing mechanical problems with the engine or airframe. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 7, 2009, about 1645 eastern standard time, an experimental Grumman TBM-3, N188TD, was destroyed following an in-flight and postlanding fire at Millville Municipal Airport (MIV), Millville, New Jersey. The certificated airline transport pilot/mechanic sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local maintenance flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was not available for interview due to his injuries. In a written statement, the owner of the airplane explained that the pilot had just completed the installation of an overhauled carburetor. The owner and the pilot/mechanic had performed test runs of the engine and completed carburetor adjustments, with no problems noted. He described multiple engine starts with and without auxiliary fuel pressure applied. During one engine run, the hydraulic components of the airplane were \"cycled\" with no problems noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter completion of the ground tests, the pilot stated he would test full-power application by flying the airplane around the traffic pattern. The owner described the takeoff and climbout from runway 14, and stated that the airplane \"appeared\" to develop full power. When the airplane was about 600 to 700 feet above ground level, on the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern, \"heavy smoke appeared all at once.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner stated that he then ran to the hangar for a fire extinguisher, and that by the time he returned, the airplane was rolling out on runway 28, completely engulfed in flames. Seconds after the airplane stopped, the engine fell from the burning airframe. At that time, the owner and other witnesses observed the pilot on the runway, about 400 feet from the airplane. The pilot spoke briefly to the owner, and stated that the airplane was \"operating properly until he heard a bang and then there was smoke and flames.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single- and multiengine land. He held 10 type ratings, including one for the accident airplane. Additionally, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine sea, and helicopter, as well as a flight instructor certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine, multiengine, and instrument airplane. The pilot held a mechanic certificate with ratings for airframe and powerplant. The pilot's most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued May 22, 2008. He reported 20,000 total hours of flight experience on that date.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the airplane was a 1945 Grumman TBM-3. The maintenance records were burned in the postaccident fire, but examination revealed that the airplane had accrued 3,012.1 total flight hours as of the last annual inspection, which was performed on May 19, 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1654, the weather reported at MIV included clear skies with variable winds from 010 degrees at 4 knots. The temperature was 16 degrees Celsius (C), and the dew point was 9 degrees C. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of photographs revealed that the airplane was consumed by fire between the engine and the tail section. The engine showed significant fire damage, and one of the three propeller blades was consumed down to its root. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was examined in Clayton, Delaware on April 2, 2009. Examination revealed that the fuel pressure indicator line was disconnected from its AN-type fitting at the carburetor. The threads of the fitting appeared undamaged, but were heavily sooted. The B-nut fitting threads at the fuel pressure indicator line also appeared undamaged, but were also heavily sooted and contained debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther examination revealed that the fuel supply, the oil supply, and scavenge lines were consumed by fire, but their associated attachment clamps were installed with remnants of the lines still attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic supply and return fittings were still installed, but heavily damaged by fire. The supply and return lines were consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AN-type fitting and the fuel pressure indicator line were retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 17, 2009, the AN-type fitting and the fuel pressure indicator line were examined in the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination revealed the AN-type fitting was threaded with male threads on both ends. One end was threaded with pipe threads and was still threaded into the carburetor housing when it was removed for shipment to the lab. These threads were properly formed and showed no evidence of damage or debris. The opposite end of the fitting was an AN-type nipple for connection to a fuel line for the fuel pressure transmitter, but was found disconnected from the fuel line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe threads of the nipple were covered in soot and contained small particles of debris consistent with exposure to a fire environment. The soot and debris were strongly adhered to the threads and required removal by brushing to inspect the condition of the threads. The threads appeared properly formed and undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe B-nut of the fuel line, which would have been connected to the AN-type nipple, was heavily oxidized on the interior and exterior surfaces, and the threads inside the B-nut contained debris. The metal over braid of the fuel line displayed localized melting consistent with electrical arcing. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During approach to runway 9, the tower controller instructed the pilot to perform an “S” turn 3 miles from the runway. The pilot initiated the “S” turn to the left, and after turning back to the right towards the runway to complete the other half of the turn, the controller advised the pilot that he did not need to finish the maneuver, and could turn onto final approach. The last recorded ground speed was 89 knots when the pilot banked the airplane sharply to the left at this time, witnesses stated that the airplane seemed to do a wing over onto its back and go straight down. Flight simulation tests revealed that while making a steep turn and not adding power, as the bank angle increased the airspeed would decrease and the airplane would enter an aerodynamic stall. Toxicology testing indicated that the pilot had been using tramadol, a prescription painkiller with potentially impairing effects. The pilot had not reported its use on his most recent application for airman medical certificate approximately 20 months prior to the accident. It is unclear what role, if any, the medication or the condition for which it might have been used played in the accident.

    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 15, 2008, at 1457 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM-700, N484RJ, was substantially damaged when it rolled inverted and collided with trees short of runway 9, at the Cobb County-McCollum Field (RYY), Kennesaw, Georgia. The certificated private pilot was killed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight from Southwest Georgia Regional Airport (ABY), Albany, Georgia, to RYY. The airplane was registered to Flying Max LLC, and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The flight originated from ABY at 1400 on the same day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following was derived from a partial transcript of the communications that occurred between N484RJ and the McCollum Flight Control Facility (FCF) Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1454:10 the pilot reported to the RYY local controller that he was inbound. At 1454:15 the tower acknowledged the call and informed the pilot that runway 9 was in use and provided him with the local weather and instructed the pilot to contact the tower when he was turning onto final approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1454:23 the pilot reported turning final. At 1455:04 the controller instructed the pilot to fly across the final approach course and make an “S” turn so he could get two departures off, the pilot did not respond and at 1455:16 the controller asked the pilot if he had copied the instructions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1455:19 the pilot reported that he was on a four-mile final. At 1455:22 the controller again asked the pilot to make one “S” turn on final so he could get a couple of departures off. Again the pilot did not respond and at 1456:14 the pilot reported that he was on a three-mile final.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1456:26 the controller told the pilot “one more “S” turn for me a Cessna departing you’re cleared to land.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1456:37 the pilot responded back “make an “S” turn.” At 1456:45 the controller told the pilot that “half an “S” turn was fine you can turn toward the runway now”. At 1456:49 the pilot acknowledged the instructions. At 1457:07 the controller attempted to contact the pilot but received no response.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses at the RYY airport stated that they observed the airplane on short final for runway 9. They heard the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower instruct the pilot to complete an \"S\" turn so that he could get two airplanes off the ground. The pilot of N484RJ acknowledged the instructions and proceeded to execute the turn. Then the witnesses stated that the airplane seemed to do a wing over onto its back and go straight down. Shortly after, a “huge” fire occurred that could be seen from the ramp.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 66, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane, issued on December 26, 2002. He also held a third-class medical certificate, issued on December 12, 2006, with the restriction that he must wear corrective lenses. The pilot reported on his last medical application that he had accumulated 975 civilian flight hours in all aircraft. The pilot’s logbook was not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to the purchase of the TBM-700, the pilot owned and operated a 1997 Piper PA-46-350P, powered by a Lycoming TIO-540 SER, 310 horsepower reciprocating engine. According to his family, he operated this airplane for a couple of years before purchasing the accident airplane. Prior to the Piper PA-46, he owned and operated a 1987 Beech F33A, powered by a Continental IO-520, 285 horsepower reciprocating engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe six-seat, low-wing, retractable-gear airplane was manufactured in 2005. It was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-64, 700 horsepower turbo-prop engine, and equipped with a Hartzell model HC-E4N-3, four bladed constant speed propeller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the airplane’s logbooks found that the airplane’s most recent 100-hour inspection was performed on July 10, 2008. According to the inspection write-up, the total time for both the engine and airframe was 398.0 hours. Estimated total time at the time of the accident was 404.0 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the airplane’s records found that the airplane had been purchased by the pilot on March 13, 2008, following a pre-buy inspection at a total airframe and engine time of 359.7 hours. A review of FAA certification records found that the airplane was registered by the pilot under the name of Flying Max LLC, on May 22, 2008. From the time the pilot had purchased the airplane until the date of the accident, the pilot had accumulated 44.3 total hours in the TBM-700.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest weather reporting station was  RYY, located approximately 1.5 miles from runway 9.  RYY reported the following: wind, 100 degrees at 6 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; sky, clear; overcast, scattered 4800 feet; temperature, 30 degrees Celsius, dew point 18 degrees Celsius; altimeter setting 30.07 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site found that the airplane had impacted into a heavily wooded city park, in a steep, nose down attitude. The airplane struck several trees and subsequently the ground, and came to an abrupt stop with no forward movement after ground contact. The airplane came to rest on a 360 degree magnetic heading, and was located 1.8 nautical miles southwest of runway 9, on a 089 degree bearing to the airport. There was a post-impact fire which consumed much of the airplane and the surrounding landscape.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage found the entire airframe consumed by the post-impact fire. The only remains were a section of right wing, small pieces of left wing panels, the engine, and a portion of the engine cowling. Examination of the flap actuators found them in the landing configuration, and the landing gear was found extended. Control cable continuity could not be established due to impact forces and the post-impact fire. No airframe anomalies were noted during the on-site examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found the reduction gearbox ruptured/fractured just forward of the second stage sun and ring gear set and was leaning towards the right-hand exhaust stack at approximately a 45-degree angle. This section had completely separated from the rest of the reduction gearbox casting which remained attached to the exhaust case.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was heavy buckling evident on the exhaust case. Heavy creasing of the duct was evident between the two exhaust stacks both at the 6 and 12 o’clock positions in a counter-clockwise direction. Both exhaust stacks were damaged. The left- and right-hand exhaust stacks were twisted clockwise looking at the exhaust stack flange and also pushed rearward. The left-hand stack sustained more twisting then the right hand stack.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was split at the “C” flange. The compressor turbine disc looked normal; however there was evidence of light rubbing at the compressor turbine blade fir trees. The rubbing was evident along the full circumference of the disc at the fir tree location. The center hub of the compressor turbine disc also showed evidence of rubbing with the power turbine interstage baffle. This was the only damage evident to the compressor turbine disc and blade set. The remainder of the combustion chamber, small exit duct and hot section area looked normal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe power turbine assembly looked normal, however there was evidence of rubbing between the turbine interstage baffle at the centre of the baffle and more at the 12 o’clock position and it appeared that this portion of the baffle was separating from rubbing the compressor turbine disc. There was also bluing of the baffle from heat which appeared more evident at the 12 o’clock position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of separation between the inlet case and accessory gearbox mating faces. The gapping was between the 9 and 12 o’clock position and the gapping was at its maximum approximately 0.060 inches. Three bolts were found sheared at the 11 to 12 o’clock positions. No preimpact damage to or failures of the engine were identified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four propeller blades sustained impact damage with the trees and ground. Two of the four blades appeared to be in the power position; the other two blades were broken within the propeller hub. The propeller blades exhibited chordwise and multi-directional scratches and leading edge damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot on July 16, 2008, by the Cobb County Office of the Medical Examiner, Marietta, Georgia. The autopsy finding reported the cause of death as sequelae of generalized trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot by the Federal Aviation Administration Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The toxicology report stated that there was no carbon monoxide, cyanide or ethanol detected in blood or urine. However, alfuzosin, bisoprolol, and quinine was detected in blood and urine, and 0.15 (ug/ml, ug/g) tramadol was detected in blood and urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s most recent application for airman medical certificate, dated 12/12/2006, noted “Yes” to “Do You Currently Use Any Medication,” and indicated the use of only bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide and ezetimibe/simvastatin. The application indicated “No” for all items under “Medical History,” except “High or low blood pressure.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Medical Examiner’s report noted, in part, that the pilot’s family indicated he “… had hypertension and had arthritis …” and the pilot’s primary care provider’s office staff indicated that the pilot, “… who had his last physical in March of this year, was being treated for hypertension, benign prostate hypertrophy, and high cholesterol. He was prescribed Ziac [bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide] 2.5 mg, one pill per day with no other medications being prescribed. …”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration was overlaid onto a local area map. The radar data showed that at 14:56:09 while on a heading of 105-degrees, a ground speed of 147 knots, altitude 960 feet above ground level (AGL) the pilot began the “S” turn to the left requested by the air traffic controller. At 14:56:32, while on a heading of 065 degrees, speed 149 knots, altitude 860 feet AGL, the pilot began his turn to the right back towards the runway. At 14:57:00, which was the last radar return showed the airplane on a heading of 114-degrees, speed 89 knots, altitude 960 feet AGL, and at that time the pilot was informed by the controller that “half an “S” turn was fine you can turn toward the runway now”. This is when the witnesses stated that the airplane seemed to do a wing over onto its back and go straight down.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the TBM-700 Pilot’s Operating Handbook, section 5, Performance, paragraph 5.5, Stall speeds, figure 5.5.1, shows that at flight idle, weight 5,512 pounds, landing gear down, flaps set for landing, the airplane’s stall speeds at 0-degrees of bank would be 57 knots indicated air speed (KIAS), 30-degrees of bank 61 KIAS, 45-degrees of bank 68 KIAS, and at 60-degrees of bank 81 KIAS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 5, 2008, the National Transportation Safety Board’s Investigator-in-charge, traveled to SIMCOM Orlando Lee Vista Training Center, Orlando, Florida, to conduct flight tests in a TBM-700, full motion flight simulator. The purpose of the test was to duplicate the pilot’s flight path up until the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous approaches were attempted simulating the pilot’s flight path. The first two  approaches were successful when the simulator pilot maintained 90 knots by adding power during the 45 to 60 degree left bank while intercepting the runway heading of 090 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remainder of the tests were performed by not adding power during the steep turn to runway heading. Each test resulted in the airplane stalling as the bank angle increased and the airspeed dropped. However, because the instructor pilot was aware of the imminent stall, he was able to recover the airplane before it crashed and make a successful landing. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot arrived at the accident airport as part of an Angel Flight volunteer program to provide transportation of a passenger who had undergone medical treatment at a local hospital. About 0937, the airplane landed on runway 30 (3,900 feet by 150 feet) with winds from 073-080 degrees and 5-6 knots, which continued to increase due to an atmospheric pressure gradient. The pilot met the passengers and departed the terminal about 1003, with winds at 101-103 degrees and 23-36 knots. About 1005 the airplane was near the approach end of runway 30 with wind from 089-096 degrees and 21-31 knots. The pilot stated that he began rotating the airplane about 3,000 feet down the runway. About 1006, the airplane was approximately 3,553 feet down the runway while flying about 30 feet above the runway. The airplane experienced an aerodynamic stall, and the left wing dropped before it impacted the ground. No mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane were noted during the investigation. The fatally injured passenger, who had received medical treatment, was 2 years and 10 months of age at the time of the accident. She was held by her mother during the flight, as she had been on previous Angel Flights, but was otherwise unrestrained.  According to 14 CFR 91.107(3), each person on board a U.S.-registered civil aircraft must occupy an approved seat with a safety belt properly secured during takeoff, and only unrestrained children who are under the age of 2 may be held by a restrained adult. Although the accident was survivable (both the pilot and the adult passenger survived with non-life-threatening injuries), an autopsy performed on the child revealed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma of the head.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 3, 2008, at 1007 central daylight time, a Socata TBM-700 (850), N849MA, owned and piloted by a private pilot, received substantial damage on impact with terrain during initial climb from runway 30 (3,900 feet by 150 feet, concrete) at Iowa City Municipal Airport (IOW), Iowa City, Iowa. Visual meteorological conditions and convective activity prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 14 CFR Part 91 Angel Flight Central, Inc. (Angel Flight) flight was operating on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The pilot and one passenger received minor injuries, and the second passenger received fatal injuries. The flight originated from IOW at 1005 and was en route to Pryor Field Regional Airport, Decatur, Alabama.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe two passengers were a mother and her daughter who had flown to Iowa City, Iowa, from Thomasville, Georgia, for a scheduled medical procedure for the daughter. The mother stated that during the past three years she had used a scheduled air carrier once to fly with her daughter to Iowa City for her daughter’s medical treatments, and thereafter, flew on Angel Flights. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShe learned of the Angel Flight program through a volunteer worker and that her daughter’s doctor had many national and international patients who used Angel Flight for transportation. She used Angel Flight for monetary and convenience reasons due to difficulties with flying on a scheduled air carrier, difficulties in security screening, and changes in medical treatment schedules, which other families had also encountered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShe visited the Angel Flight’s web site to research their program and pilot qualifications. She felt \"very good\" about Angel Flight pilot qualifications (Angel Flight requires pilots to have a minimum of 250 hours). She said that a pilot with 250 hours meant that a pilot had been in control of an airplane for that many hours. She did know the privileges associated with an instrument rating prior to flying on Angel Flights. She did not know how the pilot qualifications differ from those on commercial operations. She did understand that pilots involved in commercial operations have regulations that are more stringent, and large airplanes used by air carriers are more complex.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShe was first introduced to the pilot over the telephone when he called her telling her that he would be the pilot for her Angel Flight and arranged a meeting time of 0915 at IOW. She stated that there were \"some\" storms on the morning on the day of the accident, but when she arrived at 0845, it was drizzling. When she saw the airplane land, she could tell that there was water on the runway because upon the airplane’s touchdown, water splashed up. She thought that a \"big storm\" was not present when the airplane arrived. She met the pilot and completed the Angel Flight paperwork (passengers are required to sign an Angel Flight Transportation Authorization, Liability Release and Indemnification Form prior to flight). The pilot went to the pilot’s room and checked the weather. The pilot told her that it was clear in Alabama and did not discuss the weather any further. After their baggage was loaded, they boarded the airplane and at that time it was not raining. The pilot called the pilot in Birmingham letting him know that they were taking off and what time to expect them.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShe stated that during the taxi to runway 30, the pilot turned around and asked them if they were \"good to go.\" The pilot gave the \"thumbs up\" and turned around. She was not wearing any headsets and did not hear any radio transmissions. The pilot performed an engine run-up and checks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1503, N849MA called Cedar Rapids Approach for an IFR clearance to Decatur, Alabama, by radio, and an IFR clearance was issued; cleared as filed, maintain 10,000 feet. The final clearance altitude was flight level 290.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that during the takeoff roll, the airplane \"swerved\" to the left, \"swerved\" back to the right, and then \"straightened\" up again. She asked herself why the airplane was swerving and thought maybe it had something to do with the tires. The airplane then lifted off the runway, and \"immediately\" the airplane \"tipped dramatically\" to the left, like a banking turn. She did not remember seeing any flashing lights in the cockpit but remembered hearing a \"buzzer\" sound. The buzzer was first heard when they \"tipped sideways.\" She added that in a \"couple of seconds\" after the airplane lifted off the runway, the airplane tipped to the left and she heard the buzzer. She remembered seeing through the window that the tail \"went up.\" She then saw the ground coming towards them. The next thing she remembered was that she was pulled out of the airplane. She did not know how the emergency exit opened after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe IOW airport manager stated that he looked at the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) weather screen \"shortly\" before the airplane's takeoff. He recalled the ASOS showed the wind conditions were steady with winds of 25 knots gusting to 33 knots. He did not recall the wind direction and stated that the visual wind tee visible from the terminal building favored runway 12. He saw the airplane during its takeoff roll on runway 30. The takeoff appeared normal, but as the airplane reached the runway departure end, the airplane was about 100 feet above ground level. The airplane then \"suddenly\" went nose up and into the vertical direction. The airplane then began to roll with the nose rolling counter clockwise.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he listened to the automated surface observing system and announced his taxi intentions to runway 30 on unicom. While taxiing to runway 30, he contacted Cedar Rapids Flight Service and obtained an IFR clearance. Before takeoff, he noticed the wind was \"nearly the same as on landing,\" which was from 360 - 010 degrees and may have been 355 - 015 degrees at the time of takeoff. The first 2/3 of the takeoff was \"normal,\" but he then \"felt a wind change and gust that pushed the aircraft a little to the left.\" He \"glanced\" at the airspeed indicator, saw that it indicated a rotation speed of 85 knots, and rotated about 3,000 feet down the runway.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was issued a private pilot certificate with a single-engine land rating on September 23, 1975, and was issued an airplane instrument rating on January 1, 1997. He was issued a multiengine land rating on June 5, 1998, at total flight time of 531 hours.    The pilot reported that at the time of the accident, he had an accumulated total flight time of 5,688 hours, of which 4,388 hours were in the accident airplane make and model, 145 hours were in the last 90 days, and 58.4 hours in the last 30 days. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed his last flight review using a simulator at Simcom on April 26, 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA records for the pilot show no record of previous accidents, incidents, or enforcement actions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was a 2007 TBM 700 (850), serial number 412, that accumulated a total time of 420.0 hours. The airplane was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney of Canada, Ltd., PT6A-66D turboprop engine. The airplane was equipped with a four-bladed Hartzell HC-E4N-3 constant speed propeller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was last inspected during a 100-hour inspection on May 27, 2008, at a total time of 418 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane Weight and Balance Report, dated July 25, 2007, lists the airplane maximum takeoff weight - 7,394.2 lbs, empty weight – 4668.976 lbs, center of gravity – 21.6 percent, basic index – 57.4. The pilot reported that approximately 275 gallons of Jet A was on board at the time of the departure. FAA records list the pilot weight as 215 lbs, and the Angel Flight Mission Itinerary lists the passenger weights as 140 lbs and 24 lbs with baggage weight listed as 50 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TBM 850 Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) lists takeoff ground roll distances and takeoff distances to clear a 50 foot obstacle for weights of 5,512 lbs, 6,579 lbs, and 7,394 lbs. Corrections to theses values include:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReduce total distances of 10 percent every 10 knots of headwind&#x0D;\nIncrease total distances of 30 percent every 10 knots of rear wind&#x0D;\nIncrease by: 7 percent on hard sod, 10 percent on short grass, 15 percent on wet runway, 25 percent on high grass, 30 percent on slippery runway&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt a takeoff weight of 5,512 lbs, the takeoff ground roll and distance to clear 50 feet above ground level (D50) at an international standard atmosphere and pressure altitude of 0 and 2000 feet are listed as:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 0 feet, ground roll - 1,017 feet, D50 - 1,591 feet&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 2000 feet, ground roll - 1,132 feet, D50 - 1,772 feet&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt a takeoff weight of 6,579 lbs, the takeoff ground roll and distance to clear 50 feet above ground level (D50) at an international standard atmosphere and pressure altitude of 0 and 2000 feet are listed as:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 0 feet, ground roll – 1,378 feet, D50 – 2,133 feet&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 2000 feet, ground roll – 1,542 feet, D50 – 2,362 feet&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt a takeoff weight of 7,394 lbs, the takeoff ground roll and distance to clear 50 feet above ground level (D50) at an international standard atmosphere and pressure altitude of 0 and 2000 feet are listed as:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 0 feet, ground roll – 2,035 feet, D50 – 2,840 feet&#x0D;\nPressure altitude - 2000 feet, ground roll – 2,280 feet, D50 – 3,150 feet&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 4 of the POH, Before Starting checklist, states that the oxygen supply is to be available for the planned flight and the ‘OXYGEN’ switch is to be in the \"ON\" position. Chapter 7.10, Emergency Oxygen System, states that the oxygen system will be used by crew and passengers when the cabin altitude is greater than 10,000 feet following a loss of pressurization or cabin air contamination. The emergency indicating and control panel located in the cockpit overhead panel includes a two-position ‘OXYGEN’ to permit the supply of oxygen to the front seat masks. The panel also contains a two-position ‘PASSENGERS OXYGEN’ to permit the supply of oxygen to the four passenger masks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TBM-700 (850) is equipped with at stall sensor in the leading edge of the right wing. The sensor fitted with a vane is electronically connected to an audible warning. The vane senses the change in airflow over the wing and operates the warning unit, which produces a tone over the alarm speaker. This warning tone begins between 5 and 10 knots above the stall in all configurations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNational Weather Service Surface Analysis shows a stationary front south through southwest of IOW with a low pressure area in northeast Kansas. Easterly winds were noted north of the front. Winds were the result of the pressure gradient enhanced by the convection. Doppler weather radar for Quad Cities, Iowa, shows an area of convective activity over IOW at 0936:17 and at 1003:59, this area of activity was approximately 6.2 miles east of IOW.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe IOW ASOS, which was located at the airport, provided minute by minute observations available via telephone and on a radio frequency of 128.075 MHz. The recorded minute by minute observations for wind direction (true), wind speed, peak wind direction (true), and peak wind speed, from 0931 - 0941 and 0958 - 1009 are:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0931 - 326 degrees, 5 knots, 321 degrees, 5 knots&#x0D;\n0932 - 349 degrees, 4 knots, 015 degrees, 6 knots&#x0D;\n0933 - 012 degrees, 4 knots, 038 degrees, 5 knots&#x0D;\n0934 - 035 degrees, 4 knots, 068 degrees, 6 knots&#x0D;\n0935 - 066 degrees, 5 knots, 055 degrees, 7 knots&#x0D;\n0936 - 080 degrees, 5 knots, 073 degrees, 6 knots&#x0D;\n0937 - 086 degrees, 6 knots, 087 degrees, 11 knots&#x0D;\n0938 - 093 degrees, 8 knots, 096 degrees, 12 knots&#x0D;\n0939 - 103 degrees, 9 knots, 093 degrees, 11 knots&#x0D;\n0940 - 105 degrees, 9 knots, 111 degrees, 11 knots&#x0D;\n0941 - 103 degrees, 9 knots, 104 degrees, 11 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0958 - 100 degrees, 21 knots, 100 degrees, 28 knots&#x0D;\n0959 - 096 degrees, 21 knots, 090 degrees, 26 knots&#x0D;\n1000 - 093 degrees, 21 knots, 111 degrees, 28 knots&#x0D;\n1001 - 094 degrees, 22 knots, 097 degrees, 33 knots&#x0D;\n1002 - 098 degrees, 24 knots, 111 degrees, 30 knots&#x0D;\n1003 - 101 degrees, 23 knots, 103 degrees, 36 knots&#x0D;\n1004 - 098 degrees, 23 knots, 101 degrees, 34 knots&#x0D;\n1005 - 096 degrees, 21 knots, 089 degrees, 31 knots&#x0D;\n1006 - 095 degrees, 22 knots, 081 degrees, 29 knots&#x0D;\n1007 - 097 degrees, 25 knots, 103 degrees, 36 knots&#x0D;\n1008 - 099 degrees, 27 knots, 094 degrees, 35 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIOW is a non-towered airport with an elevation of 668 feet mean sea level. The airport has two runways, runway 07-25 (4,335 feet by 150 feet, concrete) and runway 12-30 (3,900 feet by 150 feet, concrete). The airport has the following instrument approaches: GPS RWY 25, GPS RWY 30, and VOR-A. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airport wind direction indicator was located between the terminal ramp and runway 18-36, which had been closed, and a windsock was located on top of a building east of the airport terminal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Notices to Airman, issued by IOW and valid at the time of the accident, stated that runway 07-25 was closed Monday to Friday from 0700-1900 for visual flight rules (VFR) operations. Instrument approach charts retrieved from the airplane wreckage had the following handwriting on the airport runway diagram included in the IOW approach chart(s). The handwriting has an arrow drawn to runway 07-25 and states, \"Clsd 7 AM – 7 PM IF VFR.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage, consisting of the airframe without the empennage and engine, was located in the parking lot of an office building. The main wreckage was about 0.28 miles and 282 degrees from the departure end of runway 30, at an elevation of about 682 feet mean sea level. The wreckage path was about 640 feet in length from a ground scar consistent with an initial impact point to the main wreckage. The wreckage path was oriented along a heading of about 244 degrees. The empennage was located about 100 feet behind the main wreckage. Pieces of the left wing were located in an area about 90-150 feet from the initial impact point. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller and hub assembly were located about 170 feet from the initial impact point. The propeller blades displayed S-shaped bending and twisting about the blade’s spanwise axis. One of the propeller tips was separated from its propeller blade and exhibited a granular fracture surface consistent with overload. The fracture surface of the hub shaft displayed a granular 45-degree fracture surface consistent with a torsional overload. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flaps and cockpit flap control were both in takeoff positions. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear and cockpit landing gear control were both in the down positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oxygen system supply pressure indication was 1,600 psi. The OXYGEN and PASSENGER OXYGEN switches were in the off positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe DATCON hour meter indicated 420.0 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the patient was conducted by the Johnson County Medical Examiner, Iowa City, Iowa, on June 3, 2008. The cause of death was blunt force trauma of the head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Regulation 91.107 Use of Safety Belts, Shoulder Harnesses, and Child Restraint Systems, states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(1) No pilot may takeoff a U.S.-registered civil aircraft (except a free balloon that incorporates a basket of gondola, or an airship type certified before November 2, 1987) unless the pilot-in-command of that aircraft ensures that each person on board is briefed on how to fasten and unfasten that person's safety belt and, if installed, shoulder harness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(2) No pilot may cause to be moved on the surface, takeoff, or land a U.S.-registered civil aircraft (except a free balloon that incorporates a basket of gondola, or an airship type certified before November 2, 1987) unless the pilot in command of that aircraft ensures that each person on board has been notified to fasten his or her safety belt and, if installed, his or her shoulder harness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(3) Except as provided in this paragraph, each person on board a U.S.-registered civil aircraft (except a free balloon that incorporates a basket of gondola, or an airship type certified before November 2, 1987) must occupy an approved seat or berth with a safety belt, and if installed, shoulder harness, properly secured about him or her during movement on the surface, takeoff, and landing. For seaplane and float equipped rotorcraft operations during movement on the surface, the person pushing off the seaplane or rotorcraft from the dock and their person mooring the seaplane or rotorcraft at the dock are excerpted from the preceding seating and safety belt requirements. Notwithstanding the preceding requirements of this paragraph, a person may:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(i) Be held by an adult who is occupying an approved seat or berth, provided that the person being held has not reached his or her second birthday and does not occupy or use any restraining device.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular AC 91-65, states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Safety Board found that 20 percent of the fatally-injured occupants would have survived with shoulder harness (assuming the seat belt was fastened) and 88 percent of the seriously injured could have had significantly less severe injuries with the use of shoulder harness. Energy-absorbing seats could have benefited 34 percent of the seriously injured. The Safety Board concluded that shoulder harness use is the most effective way of reducing fatalities and serious injuries in general aviation accidents.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach pilot seat and passenger seat on the accident airplane was equipped with seatbelts and shoulder harness &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Angel Flight Central Mission Itinerary, recovered form the airplane wreckage, shows that it was emailed to the pilot on June 2, 2008. The Mission Itinerary lists the daughter’s age as being older than two years old. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mother stated that she used to use a child carrier for her daughter when they initially flew but when her daughter reached the age of two, she no longer used a carrier. During previous Angel Flights, when her daughter was \"little,\" she would sit in the copilot’s seat and her daughter would be in a carrier. She stated that her daughter flew on all their previous Angel Flights unrestrained. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mother stated that the pilot of the accident airplane told her the location and operation of the normal and emergency exists, and asked her if she knew how the seat belts work and she told him she did. The pilot told her to ask him if she had any questions. She was seated in the right rear forward facing seat holding her daughter on her lap. Her daughter was not using any restraints. She held her daughter because her daughter could not fit into the airplane seat if there was a shoulder harness present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring landing at IOW, the airplane’s Global Positioning System receiver recorded a data point on runway 30, at 0936:59, at an elevation of 650 feet, and approximately 656 feet down runway 30, consistent with an airplane touchdown. Another data point was recorded at 0937:38, at an elevation of 658 feet, and approximately 3,256 feet down runway 30, followed by a turn down the runway and towards the airport terminal. A data point recorded near the airport terminal was recorded at 1003:40 at an elevation of 641 feet prior to taxi to runway 30 for takeoff. A data point was recorded at 1005:54, at an elevation of 653 feet, near the approach end of runway 30. A data point was recorded at 1006:23, at an elevation of 686 feet, and approximately 3,553 feet down runaway 30, consistent with an airplane lift-off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAeronautical charts recovered from the airplane wreckage consisted of Jeppesen US Low Altitude En Route charts. A currency review of these charts revealed the following charts to be expired at the time of the accident:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUS LO 31-32 effective 4 May 07&#x0D;\nUS LO 33-34 effective 23 Mar 07&#x0D;\nUS LO 39-40 effective 18 May 07&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Simcom TBM 700/850 pilot checklist (\"For Training Purposes Only\") was found in the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA publication, FAA-P-8740-7, The Safe Pilot's 12 Golden Rules, was developed from insurance company files on aircraft accidents and provide \"sound\" guidelines for safe operating practices, Section 9.Takeoff/Landing Limits-Plan Ahead...states, \"abort takeoff if not solidly 'airborne' in first 1/2 of runway.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Angel Flight Central pilot qualification requirements are that pilots are to have logged a minimum of 250 hours of flight time as pilot-in-command and are \"properly licensed and certified\" by the FAA. An instrument rating is \"desired.\" There is no requirement for pilot’s to hold a commercial or airline transport pilot certificate. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNational Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Statistics are available at http://www.ntsb.gov/aviation/Stats.htm. Within this site, Table 1 lists 2007 preliminary statistics for accidents, fatalities and rates. The table shows that accidents per 100,000 hours for U.S. air carriers operating under 14 CFR Part 121 scheduled was 0.128. For U.S air carriers operating under 14 CFR 135 on-demand, the accident rate for all accidents was 1.69 and the accident rate for fatal accidents was 0.38. The accident rate for all accidents for U.S general aviation was 6.84 and the accident rate for fatal accidents was 1.19. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom 1988 - 2007, Table 6 lists accidents, fatalities, and rates for air carriers operating under 14 CFR 121, scheduled air carriers. During this time period, the accident rate range for all accidents per 100,000 flight hours was 0.126 – 0.302 and the fatal accident rate range as 0.008 – 0.047. For the same time period, Table 9 list the 14 CFR 135 on-demand accident rate range for all accidents as 1.42 – 4.76 and the fatal accident rate range as 0.27 – 1.29. Table 10 lists the accident rate range for all general aviation accidents as 6.33 – 9.08 and the fatal accident rate range for fatal accidents as 1.16 – 1.82. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During the flight, the private pilot/operator was most likely seated in the left seat.  He obtained his instrument rating about 7 months prior to the accident, and had accumulated approximately 300 hours of flight experience; of which, about 80 hours were in the accident airplane.  The commercial pilot/company pilot was most likely seated in the right seat.  He had accumulated approximately 1,000 hours of flight experience; of which, about 125 hours were actual instrument experience, and 80 hours were in the accident airplane.  The commercial pilot had filed a flight plan to the wrong airport, received a weather briefing for the wrong airport, and therefore was not aware of the NOTAM in effect for an out of service approach lighting system at the destination  airport.  When the commercial pilot realized his error, he changed the flight plan, but did not request another weather briefing.  According to radar information, the airplane flew the instrument landing system runway 5 approach fast, performed a steep missed approach to 1,000 feet, and then disappeared from radar, consistent with a loss of control during the missed approach.  No preimpact mechanical malfunctions were identified with the airplane during the investigation.  The reported weather at the accident airport included an overcast ceiling at 200 feet, visibility 1 mile in light rain and mist, and wind from 160 degrees at 4 knots. The investigation could not determine which pilot was flying the airplane at the time of the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "This report was modified on December 11, 2007.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 2, 2007, about 1940 eastern standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N944CA, was destroyed when it impacted terrain in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, during a missed approach to New Bedford Regional Airport (EWB), New Bedford, Massachusetts.  The certificated commercial pilot, certificated private pilot, and a passenger were fatally injured.  Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, about 1917.  An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the business flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was based at Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE), Allentown, Pennsylvania.  The private pilot operated the airplane through his legal practice, and was visiting Massachusetts to meet colleagues.  The commercial pilot was employed as a company pilot for the legal practice.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to data from Lockheed Martin Corporation, the commercial pilot contacted the Williamsport Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) about 0925 on the day of the accident.  He filed an IFR flight plan for a trip from ABE to BOS, with a proposed departure time of 1300.  The flight service specialist accepted the flight plan, and provided a standard weather briefing for the flight, which included Notices to Airmen (NOTAM).  The airplane subsequently flew uneventfully from ABE to BOS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot contacted the Williamsport AFSS again about 1600.  He filed two IFR flight plans.  The first flight plan was from BOS to \"Bedford B-E-D,\" (erroneously, not New Bedford) with a proposed departure time of 1700.  The second IFR flight plan was from Lawrence G. Hanscom Airport (BED), Bedford, Massachusetts, to ABE, with a proposed departure time of 2000.  The commercial pilot requested a weather briefing for the flight from BOS to BED, and was provided a standard weather briefing, which included NOTAMs for BOS and BED.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot contacted the Williamsport AFSS a third time, about 1710, and advised that he needed to make changes to two IFR flight plans.  First, he asked that the destination of his first flight plan be changed from \"Bedford\" to \"New Bedford.\"  The commercial pilot then asked if the flight service specialist knew the three-letter-identifier for New Bedford as the commercial pilot was not near a map or computer at the time.  The flight service specialist then provided the correct \"EWB\" identifier for New Bedford.  The commercial pilot also changed the departure time from 1700 to 1730.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the second flight plan, the commercial pilot changed the departure point from BED to EWB, for the return flight to ABE.  The flight service specialist then stated that he would change the flight plans.  The commercial pilot thanked the specialist and ended the telephone call.  The commercial pilot did not request a weather briefing for the flight to EWB.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile at BOS, the airplane was fueled, and then departed for EWB.  According to radar and voice data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the flight proceeded toward the instrument landing system (ILS) approach for runway 5 at EWB.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1935, the flight intercepted the localizer course, about 3 miles prior to the NEFOR intersection.  At that time the airplane's radar target indicated an altitude of 1,900 feet and a groundspeed of 180 knots.  The flight was handed off from Providence Approach Control to New Bedford Tower, and subsequently cleared to land.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1936, the flight crossed NEFOR.  At that time, the airplane's radar target indicated an altitude of 1,400 feet and a groundspeed of 200 knots.  The EWB tower controller advised the flight that two preceding aircraft landed about 10 to 15 minutes prior, and \"broke out\" about 300 feet, which was acknowledged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1937, the flight was approximately 1 mile from the runway 5 threshold at EWB.  At that time, the airplane's radar target indicated an altitude of 300 feet and a groundspeed of 160 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 15 seconds later, the airplane's radar target indicated a left climbing turn to 1,000 feet, at a ground speed of 140 knots.  The radar target was subsequently lost.  During that time, one of the pilots reported a missed approach to EWB tower.  No further transmissions were received from the accident airplane after the radar target was lost.  The investigation could not determine which pilot was flying the airplane at the time of the accident.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the hours of night; located about 41 degrees, 40.06 minutes north latitude, and 70 degrees, 58.57 minutes west longitude.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot, age 23, held a commercial pilot certificate, with ratings for airplane single engine land, airplane multiengine land, and instrument airplane.  He also held a flight instructor certificate, with ratings for airplane single engine land and instrument airplane.  The commercial pilot reported 1,700 hours of total flight experience on the application for his most recent FAA first class medical certificate, issued January 8, 2007.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot completed formal training for the make and model accident airplane in July 2006, at SIMCOM, Pan Am International Flight Academy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot's logbook was recovered; however, the last entry was dated September 29, 2006.  There was no record of all of his flight time between the last entry and the day of the accident.  According to the logbook, as of the last entry, the commercial pilot had accumulated a total flight experience of approximately 1,037 hours; of which, about 113 hours were in multiengine airplanes, and 924 hours in single engine airplanes.  The commercial pilot also recorded about 125 hours in actual instrument meteorological conditions, 91 hours in night conditions, and 65 hours in the accident airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe private pilot, age 53, held a private pilot certificate, with a rating for airplane single engine land.  He obtained his private pilot certificate in November 2005.  The private pilot also obtained an instrument rating on July 24, 2006, and reported 300 hours of total flight experience on his most recent FAA third class medical certificate, issued on December 14, 2006.  The private pilot's logbook was not recovered.  According to a witness who spoke to the private pilot about 1 week prior to the accident, the private pilot reported 80 hours of flight experience in the accident airplane. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no record that the private pilot completed a formal training course for the make and model accident airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a flight instructor that had flown with both pilots, during the month prior to the accident, the private pilot flew from the left seat, with the commercial pilot in the right seat.  The flight instructor described the commercial pilot as a fantastic instrument pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor added that the private pilot flew during a 6-year period, about 10 years prior to the accident.  He did not have a pilot license at the time, but flew about 600 to 700 hours as a student pilot receiving instruction, primarily in multiengine airplanes.  The private pilot subsequently misplaced his logbook containing a record of that flight time.  The private pilot did not count that time when applying for his private pilot or medical certificates.  The flight instructor estimated that the private pilot had accumulated about 400 to 450 hours of flight experience since the lapse in flying.  The flight instructor described the private pilot as a low experience instrument pilot, who occasionally became distracted or fixated on one instrument.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was manufactured in 2001.  The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on July 7, 2006.  At that time, the airplane had accumulated 478.8 total hours of operation.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with an engine monitoring system, which periodically recorded data during different phases of flight.  According to the last record, captured during the cruise portion of the accident flight, the airplane had accumulated 647.38 hours of operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of a pilot's information manual for the same make and model as the accident airplane revealed that the published approach speed with the flap in the landing configuration was 80 knots.  Further review of the manual revealed that the flap operating range was from 60 knots to 122 knots.  The flaps could be selected to three positions:  UP (0 degrees extension); TO (10 degrees extension), and LDG (34 degrees extension).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reported weather at EWB, at 1939, was:  wind from 160 degrees at 4 knots; visibility 1 mile in light rain and mist; overcast ceiling at 200 feet; temperature 33degrees Fahrenheit (F); dew point 34 degrees F; altimeter 29.58 inches Hg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRunway 5 at EWB was 4,997 feet long, 150 feet wide, and consisted of asphalt.  The runway was equipped with a medium intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment indicator lights (MALSR), which was out of service, and a NOTAM was in effect at the time of the accident.  The runway was also equipped with high intensity runway lighting (HIRL), which was operating at the time of the accident.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument landing system approach for runway 5 at EWB had a decision altitude of 274 feet mean sea level (msl), 200 feet above ground level (agl), with a visibility requirement of 1/2 mile.  The outer marker was NEFOR, which was 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold.  The crossing height at NEFOR was 1,339 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe missed approach procedure was a climb to 700 feet, then a climbing left turn to 1,700 feet, direct to NEFOR and hold.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in a wooded area about 1 mile west of EWB, and was examined on February 3 and 4, 2007.  All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the site.  A debris path was observed, which originated with severed trees at descending heights, on an approximate 260-degree magnetic heading for about 30 feet to an impact crater.  The main wreckage was located about 30 feet beyond the impact crater, and the debris path terminated at the right wing, located just beyond the main wreckage.  The main wreckage was resting on its right side, and oriented about 100 degrees magnetic.  The horizontal stabilizer had separated from the main wreckage, and was located to the right of it.  The cockpit area had also separated from the main wreckage, and was resting to the left of it.  The left wing, the left main landing gear, and the nose landing gear were located near the impact crater.  The propeller was located near the left wing, and the engine was located near the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left wing separated near the wing root, outboard of its attachment point, and the left aileron remained attached to the wing.  The left flap had separated from the left wing, and was resting near it.  The left aileron control cables were fragmented and the cable ends were broomstrawed, consistent with overstress.  The right wing also separated near the wing root, and outboard of its attachment point.  The right main landing gear remained in the right wing.  The right aileron and right flap separated from the wing, and were located nearby.  The right aileron control cables were also fragmented and the cable ends were broomstrawed, consistent with overstress.  Each wing contained three flap actuators.  One flap actuator was recovered from the left wing, and two flap actuators were recovered from the right wing.  Measurements of all recovered actuators corresponded to an approximate 20-degree flap extended position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer had sheared off its attach points.  The left elevator remained attached, and the right elevator had separated, and came to rest near the horizontal stabilizer.  The left elevator trim tab was deflected upward and locked, consistent with impact damage, and the right elevator trim tab was approximately neutral.  Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit area to the rudder.  Flight control continuity for the elevator was confirmed from the cockpit area to the point of horizontal stabilizer separation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four propeller blades exhibited s-bending, and one blade was sheared at the tip.  The engine was disassembled for inspection.  Rotational scoring was noted on the gas generator and turbine rotors.  Examination of the cockpit revealed that the landing gear switch was in the down position; however, the switch lever had separated consistent with impact damage.  Both altimeter setting windows displayed \"29.58,\" and the radar altimeter bug was positioned to 280 feet.  The flap indicator needle was mid-range between the takeoff and landing setting.  The rudder trim needle indicated \"center,\" and the elevator trim needle was missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopsies were performed on the pilots by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Boston, Massachusetts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was conducted on the pilots at the FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit was recovered from the wreckage and forwarded to the Safety Board's Vehicle Laboratory, Washington, D.C.  Due to damage sustained in the accident, no data could be extracted from the unit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 3, 2007, the FAA conducted a flight inspection of the ILS runway 5 approach at EWB.  Review of the Flight Inspection Report revealed that the facility operation was found to be satisfactory. -",

The instructor advised his student to maintain 90 knots airspeed.  During the descent, as the airplane turned from the close in base leg onto the final approach leg, the instructor told his student \"don't bank.\"  The student rolled the wings level.  Immediately thereafter, the left bank began a second time and the instructor again said, \"Don't bank.\"  The student replied, \"I'm not.\"  The instructor applied engine power and right rudder to reduce the left bank.

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 27, 2005, about 1446 Pacific standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N198X, collided with the ground while on short final approach to runway 06 at the General Wm. J. Fox Airfield (WJF), Lancaster, California.  The right wing separated from the airframe during the subsequent impact with the ground.  The airplane was substantially damaged during the impact sequence and during the post impact ground fire.  The pilot receiving instruction owned the airplane.  Both the airline transport certificated pilot, who was providing dual flight instruction to the airplane owner, and the owner sustained minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The instructional flight originated from Camarillo, California, about 1330.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth pilots provided the National Transportation Safety Board investigator with verbal and written statements regarding the accident flight.  In pertinent part, the airplane owner reported that he had recently purchased the airplane.  The purpose of the flight was to receive dual flight instruction in the airplane in order to become more acquainted with its handling characteristics.  The owner met with his certified flight instructor (CFI) and received a briefing regarding the upcoming lesson.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was to include various maneuvers between 9,500 and 10,500 feet mean sea level.  This was to be followed by takeoff and landing practice at WJF.  After performing the maneuvers, the CFI directed the owner to perform a simulated engine-out approach to WJF.  Accordingly, the engine power was reduced between 8 and 10 percent torque, and the owner glided toward the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter arriving over the airport, the owner entered a \"close in\" downwind for runway 06, and the pilots received a clearance to land.  At the direction of the CFI, the owner performed a \"left circle base to the runway.\"  The landing gear was lowered, and the owner questioned the CFI regarding whether they could glide all the way to the runway.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CFI indicated to the owner that the airplane was in position to make the landing.  The CFI directed the owner to maintain 90 knots airspeed.  During the circling approach, as the airplane turned from the close in base leg onto the final approach leg, the CFI told the owner \"don't bank.\"  The owner rolled the wings level.  Immediately thereafter, the left bank began a second time and the CFI again said, \"Don't bank.\"  The owner replied, \"I'm not.\"  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNeither pilot recalled hearing the stall warning horn activate in the manner in which it had functioned during the earlier higher altitude maneuvers.  Neither pilot recalled the airplane buffeting.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CFI applied engine power and right rudder.  The airplane stopped rolling left, and then rolled into a right bank, whereupon the right wing impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) coordinator examined the accident site and airplane wreckage.  He reported observing a ground scar that was consistent with the initial point of impact being upwind of runway 06's landing threshold and beyond the north edge of the runway.  The outboard lower portion of the right wing was the first airframe component to impact the ground.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA inspector, the CFI indicated that during the last few seconds of flight he had applied full right rudder to reduce the left bank.  At no time did the CFI direct his student to release the airplane's flight controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRunway 06 at WJF, elevation 2,348 feet mean sea level, is 7,201 feet long by 150 feet wide.  At the time of the mishap, the reported weather was as follows:  Wind from 050 degrees at 7 knots; 10 miles visibility; scattered clouds at 15,000 feet; and temperature/dew point at 21/4 degrees Celsius, respectively. -",

The pilot performed a forced landing in an field, about 3,200 feet from the departure end of the runway.  The company director of operations (D/O) reported that when he examined the airplane about 45 minutes later, there was rough granular ice on the top surface of the wing that conformed to the outline of the fuel tanks.  The rough granular ice was not found on the horizontal stabilizer.  The pilot reported that he elected not to use liquid deicing fluid on the wings because the snow was blowing off of the top of the wings when the airplane was pulled from the hangar.  The D/O further reported that the airplane had been refueled with 177 gallons about 2 hours prior to departure and then the airplane was placed in an unheated hangar with the door open.  The fuel came from a truck that had been kept in a heated hangar.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On December 6, 2003, at 0439 eastern standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N700QD, operated by Quest Diagnostics, Inc., was substantially damaged while departing Reading Regional Airport (RDG), Reading, Pennsylvania.  The certificated airline transport pilot was not injured.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, that was destined for Norwood Memorial Airport (OWD), Norwood, Massachusetts.  An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the corporate flight that was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he came on duty at 0350, for a series of flights.  The purpose of the flights was to pick up and transport medical specimens to various regional laboratories for analysis.  The airplane was in an unheated hanger, with the doors open.  The pilot further reported:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"...At that time, I conducted a preflight inspection of the aircraft (Socata TBM-700, N700QD) assigned to that flight.  At the time of the preflight inspection, I had a conversation with the Line Service Personnel who was on duty.  It was brought to my attention that the  aircraft had completed Flight #920 earlier and had arrived at the Quest Diagnostics' hangar at approximately 0220 hrs.  At approximately 0235 hrs, the aircraft was fueled (topped off) and placed in the front of the Quest hangar.  The hangar doors were kept open and the heat was off.  The heat was off the entire night.....\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"While the aircraft was in the hangar, I conducted the preflight inspection.  Due to it snowing, I  paid close attention to ice and snow.  The aircraft was free of all ice and snow.  At such time, there were no discrepancies noted.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"At approximately 0431 hrs., Line Service pulled the aircraft out of the hangar by tug and I immediately boarded the aircraft and began the start procedure.  At that time, all systems were checked and there were no abnormalities noted.  Because it was snowing, all de-ice systems except the wing boots were utilized at this time and ATIS was received.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"At approximately 0434 hrs., I began my taxi to Runway 13 via Taxiway G and C without incident.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"At approximately 0437 hrs., I held short of Runway 13 at Taxiway C.  At that time, I conducted a run-up of the aircraft and \"last minute\" line checks were completed.  No abnormalities were noted.  Due to a contaminated runway (snow), zero flaps were used as per POH.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt approximately 0439 hrs, I began the takeoff roll.  Prior to rotation, all systems and engine gauges were checked.  All good, a seemingly normal takeoff roll with snow on the runway.  At approximately 90 kts, I began rotation (somewhere prior to Taxiway D intersection).  Approximately 4 - 5 seconds after lift off, the aircraft began to shake severely.  At that time, engine instruments were checked and all were normal, and airspeed was checked at 110 kts.  It was clear to me that the aircraft was not climbing.  I held 110 kts. as long as I  thought I could.  At  that point, I felt that putting the aircraft back on-the-ground was not an option.  I believed a straight out climb was the only option.  I then increased the pitch angle to approximately 80 kts.  At that point, the stall horn was heard.  I then pushed the yoke forward.  For the remainder of the flight, I basically kept the wings level and the airspeed just above stall.  The aircraft came to rest approximately one (1) mile southeast of the airport in a construction site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a follow-up interview, the pilot reported that he elected not to de-ice the wings because the snow was blowing off the top of the wing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company director of operations reported that the fuel used to refuel the airplane came from a truck that had been kept in a heated hanger.  Further, when he examined the airplane about 45 minutes after the accident, he observed that the fuselage was wrinkled, the landing gear had collapsed, and the right wing was separated from the fuselage.  The outboard portion of one propeller blade was missing, and not recovered.  In addition, rough granular ice was observed on the tops of both wings.  The shape of the ice defined the shape of the fuel tank in each wing.  No ice was observed outboard of the fuel tanks, or on the top of the horizontal stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located about 3,200 feet from the departure end of the runway 13, on a magnetic heading of 118 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller blade with the missing tip was sectioned below the fracture and forwarded to the Safety Board Materials Laboratory for examination.  The examination revealed features typical overstress bending.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 0426 weather observation at Reading included winds from 020 degrees at 11 knots, visibility 1/2 statute mile, snow, freezing fog, and a ceiling of 300 feet broken.  The temperature and dew point were -3 degrees Celsius and -4 degrees Celsius, respectively. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A review of communications between Mobile Downtown Control Tower, and the pilot revealed that while on approach the pilot reported having a problem. The Ground Controller reported that he had the airplane in sight and cleared the flight to land on runway 18. The pilot stated that he had a \"run away engine\", and elected to shut down the engine and continued the approach. The Controller then cleared the pilot again to runway 18. The pilot then stated that he did not think that he was going to \"make it.\" The airplane collided with a utility pole and the ground and burst into flames short of the runway. The post-accident examination of the engine found that  the fuel control unit arm to the fuel control unit interconnect rod end connection was separated from the rod end swivel ball assembly. The swivel ball assembly was found improperly attached to the inboard side of the arm, with the bolt head facing inboard, instead of outboard, and the washer and nut attached to the arm's outboard side instead of the inboard side. The rod separation would resulted in a loss of power lever control. The published emergency procedures for \"Power Lever Control Lose,\" states; If minimum power obtained is excessive: 1) reduce airspeed by setting airplane in nose-up attitude at IAS &lt; 178 KIAS. 2) \"inert Sep\" switch--On. 3) if ITT &gt;800 C \"Inert Sep\"--Off. 4) Landing Gear Control--Down. 5) Flaps--Takeoff. 6) Establish a long final or an ILS approach respecting  IAS &lt; 178 KIAS. 7) When runway is assured:  Condition Lever to --Cut Off. 8) Propeller Governor Lever to--Feather. 9) Flaps --Landing as required (at IAS &lt;122 KIAS). 10) Land Normally without reverse. 11) Braking as required. The pilot stated to Mobile Downtown Control Tower, Ground Control that he had a \"run away engine\" and that he \"had to shut down the engine\". As a result of the pilot not following the published emergency procedures, the airplane was unable to reach the runway during the emergency. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 24, 2003 at 2012 central daylight time, a Socata TBM 700B, N705QD, registered to Fleet National Bank and operated by Quest Diagnostics, collided with a utility pole and the ground, and burst into flames one-half mile short of runway 18, at the Mobile Downtown Airport in Mobile, Alabama. The flight was being operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight plan was filed. The Airline Transport Pilot received fatal injuries, the airplane sustained substantial damage and there was a post-crash fire. The flight originated from Lawrenceville, Georgia, at 1845 on April 24, 2003. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of communications between Mobile Downtown Control Tower, Ground Control and N705QD, Lab Quest Eight Five Zero revealed that while on approach to Mobile Downtown Airport, Lab Quest contacted the Controller and informed him that he was having a problem. Ground Control informed the pilot  that he was in sight and was cleared to land on runway 18, and could he be of assistance. The pilot responded that he had a \"run away engine\" or properly stated as a power lever control loss. Ground Control asked the pilot, if he could help. The pilot replied \"no sir\" that he had to shut down the engine and come in on runway 14.  Ground Control informed the pilot that the first  2,600 feet of runway 14 was closed but that he was cleared to land on runway 14 or runway 18 his choice, and that the winds were at 150 degrees, at 13. The Controller then informed the pilot, that he was headed straight into runway 18 \"now that's where you're going is that correct\"?, the pilot responded yes sir. The pilot then stated that he did not think that he was going to make it and that they might want to roll the trucks. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane collided with a light pole 1800 feet short of runway 18 at 35 feet above the ground, separating five feet of the right wing. The airplane impacted the street inverted and came to rest engulfed in flames 477 feet from its initial contact with  the light pole. Witnesses ran to the airplane and assisted the pilot after he emerged from the  flames. The pilot was transported to the University of South Alabama Medical Center where he later succumbed to his injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of information on file with the Federal Aviation Administration Airman's Certification Division, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, revealed the pilot was issued an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate on December 17, 1998, with ratings for Airplane Multiengine Land, and a Commercial Pilot Certificate for airplane single engine land. A review of records on file with the FAA Aero Medical Records revealed the pilot held a first-class medical certificate issued on July 29, 2002 with no waivers or limitations. The pilot reported on his application for the medical certificate that he had accumulated 12,000 total flight hours. According to Quest Diagnostics, the pilot had accumulated 408 hours total time in the TBM 700B, including 177 hours in the last 90 days.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that the airplane was on an FAA Approved Airworthiness Inspection Program (AAIP).  The airplane's most recent inspection was a \"C\" Check which was accomplished on April 9, 2003. The airframes total time at the time of inspection was 1,183.7 hours, and the engines total time was 1,187.7 hours. On April 21, 2003 the fuel control on the engine was removed and replaced with an overhauled fuel control. The fuel control was rigged at high idle, low idle, reverse stop and max NG stop. A ground run was performed and an operational/leak check was done with no defects noted. According to the maintenance write-up, all work had been done in accordance with Pratt &amp; Whitney’s maintenance manual Chapter 73-10-00, by Craig Air Center, Inc.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest weather reporting facility at the time of the accident was Mobile Downtown Airport in Mobile, Alabama. The 1953 surface weather observation was: 2,700 feet broken, visibility 10 statute miles, temperature 73-degrees Fahrenheit, dew point temperature 66-degrees Fahrenheit, wind 150-degrees at 12 knots, and altimeter 29.81. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane found that it had come to rest inverted about 1,000 feet short of the runway on an access road near an industrial parking area. The airframe from the cockpit seats including the instrument panel aft, had been fire damaged. The left horizontal stabilizer, right elevator and vertical stabilizer with rudder were identifiable in an ash outline, and found at the approximate airplane position they would be normally. Control continuity was not established due to the fire damage. All of the cockpit instruments were in their proper location but badly burned and unreadable. The landing gear was found in the retracted position. The right wing outboard five feet and about 7 feet of the right flap and aileron had separated on initial impact with the light pole. The remainder of the right wing remained with the wreckage and was damaged in the post crash fire aft of the main wing spar. The left wing remained with the fuselage, however the sections of the wing outboard of the fuel tank were fire damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found it intact in the airframe nacelle, and no fire damage was present. The cowling and inlet shrouding displayed severe deformation with deep gouges and scrape marks running longitudinally along the surface of the upper cowling. The accessory gearbox housing was intact. The fuel control unit and high pressure fuel pump were intact. The fuel-control manual over-ride lever was found in the maximum flow position. The input clevis fitting was  fractured. The fuel control unit condition lever linkage was found intact.  The fuel control unit arm to fuel control unit interconnect rod end connection was found separated from the rod end swivel ball assembly. The swivel ball assembly was found attached to the inboard side of the arm, with the bolt head facing inboard, and the washer and nut attached to the arm's outboard side. The rod end bronze bearing surface displayed heavy wear and material smearing. The remainder of the power control and reversing linkage connections were intact and were found to be assembled in their correct sequence and orientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the 1st and 2nd stage power turbine sections found circumferential scoring of varying degrees around their shrouds, power turbine blades and blade tips.  Examination of 1st and 2nd stage gearing in the reduction gearbox found no indications of operational distress. The fuel control, high pressure fuel pump, propeller governor, and over speed governor were removed and forwarded to Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, Mobile, Alabama, conducted a postmortem examination of the pilot on April 25, 2003. The reported cause of death was 100 percent body surface area burns, smoke inhalation, and thermal inhalation injuries. The Forensic Toxicology Research Section, Federal Aviation Administration, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma performed postmortem toxicology of specimens from the pilot. No carbon monoxide or cyanide were detected in the blood, no ethanol was detected in vitreous. Etomidate and 0.702 (ug/ml, ug/g) Morphine were detected in the blood, etomidate and 1.95 (ug/ml, ug/g) morphine was detected in the urine, and were administered at the University of South Alabama Emergency room. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination and testing of the Fuel Control, revealed that the start and acceleration checks, verified at various P3 pneumatic pressure and speeds from low to high regimes, to be within acceptance requirements. Maximum flow checks identified an output flow of 660 pph, which is with the calibration requirements of 640 - 660 pph. Maximum relief valve pressure setting was observed to be 1180 psid, which was slightly below the minimum calibration setting of 1200 psid. No leakage was observed from the overboard drain. Shutdown verification identified positive fuel cutoff when the shutdown valve was actuated. Additionally, manual override lever checks identified an output flow of 572 pph when the lever was actuated to its maximum stop. This was above the calibration requirements of 407 to 430 pph. The manual override lever maximum stop position was observed to be set at 60 degrees, which was within the calibration setting of 55.2 to 61.2 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the Fuel Pump, found the drive coupling intact. Pump capacity  at a low pad speed of 810 rpm identified an output flow of 225pph, which was above the minimum overhaul acceptance limit of 214 pph. At a high pad speed of 6350 rpm, the output flow was observed to be 1724 pph, which was above the minimum overhaul acceptance limit of 1698 pph. Bypass valve checks were within acceptance requirements. Following the above tests, the unit was removed from the test stand in order to perform a visual inspection of the outlet filter. The filter was observed to be clean. The unit was considered to be reacting well to the test inputs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the propeller governor found that it had severe impact damage. The speed setting lever, shaft, and stops were missing as observed. The cover was fractured and severed from the main body assembly exposing the internal housing cavity and internal details. The reset post was bent and the drive was fractured adjacent to the drive splins. Disassembly of the governor base found the plunger assembly seized in the drive gear. The gears were found in satisfactory condition. Swipe marks from the gears were found on the base, and on the housing gear walls. The flyweights were removed and found to be moving freely on their pivots. The cavity of the governor body assembly was found in satisfactory condition. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the over speed governor found it in a testable condition. Functional tests found a maximum over speed setting of 4047 rpm, which was within the calibration range of 4037 to 4057 rpm. The reset solenoid was then activated which revealed a reset over speed setting of 3525 rpm, or 5 rpm below the minimum reset calibration setting of 3530 rpm. No external leakage was noted during the functional tests. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage of N705QD, the aircraft logbooks and the components retained for further testing were released to U.S. Aviation Underwriters, on August 31, 2004.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated to Mobile Downtown Control Tower, Ground Control that he had a \"run away engine\" and that he \"had to shut down the engine\". Examination of the engine found that  the fuel control unit arm to fuel control unit interconnect rod end connection was separated from the rod end swivel ball. The swivel ball was found improperly attached to the inboard side of the arm, with the bolt head facing inboard, and the washer and nut attached to the arm's outboard side. According to the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Maintenance Manual Ref. 76-10-00 Figure 1, Propeller Reversing Interconnect Linkage Installation, Rear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the TBM Pilot's Information Manual, Section 3, Emergency Procedures, 3.3 Engine Failures; Engine Regulation Discrepancy, Power Loss, Power Lever Control Lose, states in part:   If minimum power obtained is excessive: 1) reduce airspeed by setting airplane in nose-up attitude at IAS &lt; 178 KIAS. 2) \"inert Sep\" switch--On. 3) if ITT &gt;800 C \"Inert Sep\"--Off. 4) Landing Gear Control--Down. 5) Flaps--Takeoff. 6) Establish a long final or an ILS approach respecting  IAS &lt; 178 KIAS. 7) When runway is assured:  Condition Lever to --Cut Off. 8) Propeller Governor Lever to--Feather. 9) Flaps --Landing as required (at IAS &lt;122 KIAS). 10) Land Normally without reverse. 11) Braking as required. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot, who sat in the left seat, was executing the LOC RWY 17 instrument approach in actual instrument meteorological conditions, when the airplane decelerated, lost altitude, and began a left turn about 2 miles from the airport.  Subsequently, the airplane collided with terrain and came to rest on residential property.  The radar data also indicated that the airplane was never stabilized on the approach.  A witness, a private pilot, said the airplane \"appeared\" out of the fog about 300-400 feet above the ground.  It was in a left bank, with the nose pointed down, and was traveling fast.  The airplane then \"simultaneously and suddenly level[ed] out,\" pitched up, and the engine power increased.  The witness thought that the pilot realized he was low and was trying to \"get out of there.\"  The airplane descended in a nose-high attitude, about 65 degrees, toward the trees.  Radar data indicates that the airplane slowed to 80 knots about 3 miles from the airplane, and then to 68 knots 18 seconds later as the airplane began to turn to the left.

An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight that originated at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP), Greer, South Carolina, about 1230.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses observed and heard the airplane.  According to one witness, a private pilot and an airplane owner based at Leesburg, he was in his truck approaching a stop sign when he first saw and heard the airplane. He said the airplane \"appeared\" out of the fog about 300-400 feet above the ground, directly in front of where he was located.  The airplane was in a \"slight left bank\" (10-15 degrees), with the nose pointed \"slightly down\" (about 20-25 degrees), and traveling fast.  The airplane was in a left turn, moving south to east, and toward the north. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness then observed the airplane to \"simultaneously and suddenly level out,\" pitch up (20-25 degrees), and increase power. The change in engine sound was similar to when an airplane applied power for take-off.  The witness thought that the pilot realized he was low and was trying to \"get out of there.\"  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane continued to descend in the nose-high attitude toward the trees.  The witness estimated the descent angle of the airplane to be 65 degrees, before he lost sight of it as it descended behind trees. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness described the attitude of the airplane.  He said, \"It looked as if he got on the backside of the power curve... If he had had more altitude, he may have recovered.  But, even if he did recover, there was still a ridge directly in front of his position that he would have had to clear, and I am not sure if he would have been able to do that.\" The witness also noted that the engine was operating normally, and the weather was foggy with low visibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA second witness stated that she was on her back porch about 1/8 mile from the accident site, when she heard an airplane engine getting \"louder and louder.\"  She then stepped off her porch and went out into her backyard.  When she looked up, the airplane flew directly overhead going east bound, and it was about five stories above the ground. The belly of the airplane was parallel to the ground and was colored blue. The landing gear was not extended.  The engine sounded \"loud and constant\" the entire time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane then made a sharp left bank and started to turn toward the north.  It continued to increase the left bank, when the nose dropped down into the trees, and the witness lost sight of it.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness also described the weather as a gray overcast, but not foggy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA third witness was in his yard, which he stated was about 1/4 mile from the accident site.  He first heard an airplane flying low overhead.  When he looked up, he saw it exiting the clouds, about four stories above the ground, in a level attitude, headed east.  The airplane then made a sharp left bank and started to turn towards the north.  The nose of the airplane \"was being pulled up\" while in the turn.  It then dropped, and pointed down toward the ground.  The witness did not see the airplane hit the ground, but noted that the engine sounded as if it was \"cutting in-and-out\" before impact.  The witness also noted that the weather was \"very foggy.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA fourth witness was in her backyard, located across the street from the accident site.  She heard the sound of an airplane engine \"revving up and down.\"  The witness then looked up and saw the airplane on its side, descending through the trees.  It was \"teetering\" back and forth as it descended, and the top of it was facing her direction.  The witness also described the weather as foggy.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA fifth witness said that he heard an airplane that sounded really low, but could not see it.  The engine sounded \"normal\", then faded for about 10 seconds, then began to \"surge\" or \"race\".  Two to 3 seconds later, he heard a crashing sound.  The witness also stated that the weather was extremely cloudy and foggy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA sixth witness was in his home, which was located \"very nearly under\" the localizer approach and about 3 miles from runway 17 at Leesburg Executive Airport.  He first heard the sound of the engine, which he described to be in \"approach\" mode or idle RPM.  The witness thought the airplane was at the same altitude as his home, about 250 above ground level.   The witness moved to the front of his home and looked outside in an attempt to see the airplane, but the visibility was less than 100 feet.  Based on what he heard, and where he residence was located, the witness stated, \" the airplane had descended considerably below the minimum descent altitude far short of the runway.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of air traffic control communications revealed that the pilot received radar vectors to intercept the localizer course for the LOC RWY 17 approach.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1429, an approach controller provided the current altimeter setting and asked the pilot if had the current weather conditions.   The pilot acknowledged the altimeter setting and reported that he had the current weather information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1440, the approach controller instructed the pilot to intercept the localizer course, and the pilot acknowledged.  About 1 minute later, the approach controller advised the pilot that he was located 3 miles north of WARDE intersection (final approach fix), to maintain 3,000 feet until established, and that he was cleared for the LOC RWY 17 approach.  The pilot acknowledged.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1442, the approach controller advised the pilot to cancel IFR services with Leesburg Flight Service Station (FSS) once on the ground, and approved a change in radio frequency for airport advisories. The pilot acknowledged, and there were no further communications from the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of radar data revealed an instrument flight rules (IFR) target approaching the Leesburg Airport from the north west.  Examination of the last 4 minutes of radar data revealed the target turned toward the south about 9 miles from the end of runway 17.  At that time the target was at an altitude of 3,100 feet msl and at a ground speed of 180 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the target continued to maneuver toward the south, it made a series of left and right hand turns along the localizer course.  When the target was about 5 miles north of the runway, it was at an altitude of 1,700 feet msl and at an airspeed of 130 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the airplane continued to proceed toward the airport, it continued to make left and right hand turns along the course.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the airplane crossed over the final approach fix, about 4 miles north of the airport, it was at an altitude of 1,700 feet msl, at a ground speed of 91 knots.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the target was approximately 3 miles north of the airport, it was at an altitude of 800 feet msl, at a ground speed of 80 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEighteen seconds later, the target began a left turn to the east before the data ended at 1445:29. The last radar target was located at 38 degrees, 57 minutes north latitude, and 77 degrees, 27 minutes west longitude, at an altitude of 700 feet msl, and at a ground speed of 68 knots.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the hours of daylight approximately 39 degrees, 07 minutes north latitude, and 77 degrees, 34 minutes west longitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot in the left seat held a private pilot certificate with ratings for single engine land and instrument airplane.  His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second class medical certificate was issued on August 09, 2002.  At that time, he reported 730 hours of flight experience.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral requests were made to the family to obtain the pilot's personal logbooks.  However, they were not made available for review. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSECOND PERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot in the right seat held an airline transport pilot certificate for airplane multi-engine land, with ratings for the ATR-42, ATR-72, B-737, and DHC-7.  He also held a commercial pilot certificate for airplane single engine land, a certified flight instructor certificate for airplane single engine land, airplane multi-engine land, and instrument airplane.  His most recent FAA second class medical certificate was issued on November 18, 2002.  At that time, he reported 8,375 hours of flight experience.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's wife, he carried a logbook with him during trips, in a jacket pocket.  However, the jacket and logbook were never located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth pilots completed TBM-700 ground and simulator/flight proficiency training at SIMCOM International, Inc. Pilot Training Center, Orlando, Florida, in December 2002.   A review of training records revealed that both pilots practiced IFR procedures, which included a LOC approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a representative of the owner's insurance company, the pilot's insurance policy required a second pilot to be in the cockpit anytime the pilot was flying the airplane.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Socata TBM 700 was a single-engine turboprop, 6-7 seat, high-performance, pressurized, fixed-wing airplane.  Examination of maintenance records revealed that the airplane and the Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A-64 (750 SHP) engine underwent an annual inspection on May 24, 2002, at a total time of 1,049.1 hours each.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the engine and airplane had each accrued a total of 1,175 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather reported at the airport, at 1400, included winds from 150 degrees at 5 knots, temperature 37 degrees F, dewpoint 35 degrees F, and altimeter setting 30.14 inches Hg.  The visibility was 1 statute mile and the ceiling was 500 feet overcast. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather reported at the airport, at 1420, included winds from 140 degrees at 5 knots, temperature 37 degrees F, dewpoint 35 degrees F, and altimeter setting 30.13 inches Hg.  The visibility was 1 statute mile and the ceiling was 500 feet overcast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather reported at the airport, at 1440, included winds from 140 degrees at 5 knots, temperature 37 degrees F, dewpoint 35 degrees F, and altimeter setting 30.13 inches Hg.  The visibility was 1 statute mile and the ceiling was 300 feet overcast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather reported at the airport, at 1500, included winds from 140 degrees at 4 knots, temperature 37 degrees F, dewpoint 35 degrees F, and altimeter setting 30.12 inches Hg.  The visibility was 1 statute mile and the ceiling was 300 feet overcast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIDS TO NAVIGATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe published inbound course for the LOC RWY 17 approach was 171 degrees magnetic, and the minimum descent altitude was 720 feet above mean sea level (msl). The crossing altitude at WARDE intersection was 1,800 feet msl.  The distance between WARDE and the missed approach point, which was located at the end of runway 17, was 3.9 nautical miles.  The airport elevation was 389 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe published weather minimums for the LOC RWY 17 approach included a 400-foot ceiling and 1-mile visibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAERODROME INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLeesburg Executive Airport runway 17 was a 5,500-foot-long and 100-foot-wide asphalt runway, which was equipped with a 4-light precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system, medium intensity runway lights (MIRL), a five-light omni-directional approach lighting system (ODALS), but no runway end identifier lights (REIL).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Airport Manager, the Localizer and the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) were examined after the accident, and no anomalies were noted.  Both systems were re-certified and put back into service.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was examined at the site on March 1-3, 2003.  All major components were accounted for at the scene.  The airplane came to rest upright, in the backyard of a private residence, on a heading of 045 degrees, at a ground elevation of approximately 395 feet msl, about 2 nautical miles north of the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInitial tree impact scars started about 75 feet from the main wreckage, and several broken tree branches were located at the base of the approximately 75-foot trees.  Tree impact scars became progressively lower on the trees in the direction of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral cut tree branches were found along the wreckage path.  Examination of the branches revealed that the ends were cut at approximately 45-degree angles.  The surface of the cuts exhibited black paint transfer marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outboard section of the right elevator, a section of right wing fuel tank, the right main landing gear without its tire, and the inboard section of the left wing were found scattered along the wreckage path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main fuselage was relatively intact.  Examination of the fuselage revealed some wrinkles starting after the engine compartment and back toward the tail along the left and right side of the fuselage.  The base of the vertical stabilizer was cracked and buckled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right wing was separated outboard of the wing root.  An approximately 4-foot section of the forward and rear wing spars remained attached to the fuselage at the wing root, and were displaced aft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right wing came to rest inverted and was sitting underneath the fuselage.  The flap and aileron were separated, exhibited impact damage, and were located near the right wing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left wing was separated at the wing root, except for a small portion of structure, which supported the left main landing gear.  The wing structure was fragmented. A 5- to 6-foot long inboard section of the wing came to rest next to the tail section, and exhibited leading edge impact damage. The flap also separated, and exhibited impact damage. The remaining portion of the wing, with the aileron intact, came to rest up against a fence located to the left of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established for both ailerons to the wing root.  However, the cables were separated, and exhibited \"broomstraw\" ends, consistent with overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vertical stabilizer was intact, and did not exhibit any impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rudder was intact, but the base of the rudder trim exhibited some impact damage.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer remained partially attached to the tail cone, was tilted to the left, and was displaced downward.  Examination revealed some leading edge impact damage on both sides.  The left elevator and left trim tab were intact.  The inboard section of the right elevator and trim tab were separated.  The left elevator push-pull tube remained attached to the elevator lever arm.  The right elevator push-pull tube remained attached to the elevator lever arm, but the elevator lever arm was separated.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established from the tail control surfaces to the aft cabin area.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that it was intact in the airframe nacelle.  The engine mount was separated from the firewall structure at the lower right, upper right, and upper left locations.  The upper rear cowling was separated and was lying immediately forward of the main engine.  There was no fire damage.   All engine-to-airframe connections were intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller and propeller shaft were separated and came to rest approximately 15 feet forward of the engine.  The propeller servo piston and cylinder were fractured from the hub.  The blades rotated freely on the hub mounts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne blade was bent forward approximately 30 degrees from approximately mid-span, and the tip was slightly deformed toward low pitch.  The second blade was positioned toward low pitch and slightly aft from approximately mid-span.  The third blade was bent aft toward low pitch starting at the blade root.  The fourth blade was also bent aft and toward low pitch from approximately mid-span, and the tip was wrinkled toward the tip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach blade exhibited leading edge nicks and chordwise scratching.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was examined on July 8-9, 2003, at the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Service Investigation Facilities at St. Hubert, Quebec, Canada, under the supervision of the Safety Board.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCircumferential scoring was displayed by the compressor impeller, the impeller shroud, the compressor turbine, the first stage power turbine vane ring, the first stage power turbine due to their making axial contact with their adjacent components under impact loads and external housing deformation.  The compressor shrouds, the compressor turbine shroud, and the power turbine shrouds displayed extensive circumferential rubbing and scoring due to their making contact with their adjacent  rotors under impact loads and external housing deformation.  The reduction gearbox propeller shaft was fractured in torsion due to power absorbed during the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel heater revealed the thermal valve to be in the full hot position.  The thermal element was found to be non-responsive.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the pneumatic air lines, compressor discharge (P3), and the power turbine control (Py) revealed that the Py line was intact from the fuel control fitting to the torque limiter.  The propeller governor fitting exhibited impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chip detector was recovered separately in its mounting boss.  The magnetic elements were clean.  The oil, fuel, and P3 filters were also absent of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel heater, the fuel control unit and the fuel pump were functionally tested, and no anomalies were noted&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller governor was functionally tested, with minor deviations attributable to field adjustment.  The overspeed governor could not be tested because the flyweights were impact damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe torque limiter was functionally tested and no anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the pilot and co-pilot altimeters revealed that both were set at 30.13 inches Hg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopsies were performed on both pilots, on March 3, 2003, by the Medical Examiner's Office, Fairfax, Virginia. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testings were conducted by the FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the past 6 years, there were 4 fatal airplane accidents in and around Leesburg, Virginia.  Three of the accidents, including this accident,  involved pilots who had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) to execute the LOC RWY 17 non-precision instrument approach.  The other accident involved a pilot who reported an engine problem.  Three of the accidents occurred within 9 months of each other, and 2 of the accidents occurred within 3 weeks of each other.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince the events of September 11, 2001, overall general aviation (GA) traffic has experienced a downturn of about 5-10 percent.  However, Leesburg Airport's traffic has seen an increase relative to the overall GA industry, especially in the high-end categories of jet, turboprop, and high performance piston aircraft.  Because of new security requirements around Washington, many of the operators who would have formerly used Reagan National airport now use Leesburg.  According to airport authorities, based aircraft comprise about 5 percent jet aircraft, which is far more than the usual 1-2 percent ratio for airports with similar activity levels.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 21, 2003, the Safety Board presented a safety suggestion to the manager of the Leesburg Executive Airport to incorporate a vertical guidance system to the existing instrument landing approach at the airport.  Such vertical guidance could have been provided by the installation of glide slope equipment with appropriate procedures, and/or by the incorporation of global positioning system (GPS) LNAV/VNAV (lateral/vertical navigation) and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) enhanced GPS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn December 2003, the President of the United States signed an appropriation bill, which allocated the FAA 1 million dollars to install an Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Leesburg Executive Airport.  According to a representative of the airport, as of January 2003,  the town was in negotiations to purchase the land needed for the installation of the ILS equipment shack.  Once the land was acquired, the FAA would conduct an environmental assessment and have the system designed and installed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was released on July 16, 2003, to a representative of  the salvage company. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The approach was stabilized at 100 knots with landing gear and flaps in the landing position.  The approach was normal until approximately 100 feet above the runway at which time the airplane encountered a turbulence condition causing rapid-roll tendencies right and left.  As the student began his landing flare at about 15 feet above the runway, the left wing dropped rapidly combined with a sudden high sink rate.  At that point the flight instructor  took control of the airplane, applying corrective rudder, aileron, pitch and power corrections. Despite the flight instructor's actions, the left wing struck the runway.  Winds at the time were reported 310 degrees at 6 knots. The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. Records suggest that the winds were variable throughout the day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On February 15, 2003, at 1601 mountain standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N700GJ, was substantially damaged when it dragged a wing during landing at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, Aspen, Colorado. The airline transport pilot flight instructor, the private pilot receiving instruction, and their two passengers were not injured.  RBL Aviation LLC, of Carlsbad, California, was operating the airplane under Title 14 CFR Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that originated at approximately 1515 from Centennial Airport, Englewood, Colorado. The pilot was flying under an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor said the instrument rated private pilot flew the VOR/DME approach to runway 15, and they broke out of the clouds at approximately 11,500 to 12,000 feet. He said the approach was stabilized at 100 knots with landing gear and flaps in the landing position. \"The approach was normal until approximately 100 feet above the runway at which time the airplane encountered a probable wind shear or wake turbulence condition causing rapid-roll tendencies right and left. As the [student] began his landing flare at about 15 feet above the runway the left wing dropped rapidly combined with a sudden high sink rate.\" At that point the flight instructor said he took control of the airplane, \"applying corrective rudder, aileron, pitch and power corrections.\" Despite the flight instructor's actions, the left wing tip struck the runway.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn airport employee was at the A-2 intersection, 1/4-mile from where the event took place. The employee observed the aircraft, during the landing flare, rise suddenly 6 to 10 feet. The aircraft then banked hard to the left. The employee noted that there were no unusual winds; they were nearly calm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWinds at the time were reported 310 degrees at 6 knots. The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. According to weather records, the winds had been variable throughout the day. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the left wing revealed that four outboard ribs were bent, an aileron hinge was abraded, the upper wing skin was wrinkled, and the spoiler push rod was bent. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airplane was fueled to capacity and placed in a heated hangar about one hour before departure.  The instrument rated pilot obtained a weather briefing, filed an IFR flight plan, and obtained an IFR clearance.  Low ceiling, reduced visibility, and ice fog prevented control tower personnel from observing the takeoff.  Radar (NTAP) and on-board GPS data indicated the airplane began drifting to the left of runway centerline almost immediately after takeoff. The airplane made a climbing left turn, achieving a maximum altitude of 7,072 feet and completing 217 degrees of turn, before beginning a descending left turn.  The airplane impacted terrain on airport property. Autopsy/toxicology protocols were unremarkable.  There was no evidence of preimpact failure/malfunction of the airframe, powerplant, propeller, or flight controls.  The autopilot and servos, pitot-static system, and flight instruments were tested and all functioned satisfactorily.  The pilot's shoulder harness was found attached to the seatbelt, but the male end of the seatbelt buckle was broken.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 26, 2001, at 0719 mountain standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N300WC, owned and operated by Technical Leasing, Inc., of Cincinnati, Ohio, was destroyed when it impacted terrain following a loss of control on takeoff at Centennial Airport, Englewood, Colorado. The instrument rated private pilot, the sole occupant aboard, was fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plan had been filed for the business flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 91. The flight originated from Centennial Airport at 0718.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot landed at Centennial Airport on the afternoon before the accident (data downloaded from the Garmin GPSMAP 295 that was on board the airplane indicates the arrival was some time after 1341). He instructed Jet Center officials to refuel the airplane to capacity. This was done at 1430 and required 136 gallons of Jet-A fuel. The pilot was met by friends, who took him to dinner and a movie that evening. They said the pilot retired approximately 2300.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to these friends, the pilot did not eat breakfast the next morning. He telephoned the FBO about 0515 and asked that the airplane be brought inside a hanger and preheated (it had been parked outdoors on the ramp overnight). This was done and the airplane was in the heated hangar approximately 45 to 60 minutes. According to FAA documents, the pilot telephoned the Denver Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) at 0608 and obtained a standard weather briefing. He then filed an IFR flight plan to Santa Monica Airport in California.  The pilot's host said he dropped the pilot off at the airport approximately 0615.  He said it was snowing at the time, and visibility was poor.  Jet Center linemen said the pilot did not perform a preflight inspection, but boarded the airplane, started the engine, and did a 20 minute engine run at \"high rpm\" on the ramp.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0647, the pilot received his IFR clearance, and at 0708 he was cleared to taxi. Because the wind was calm, the pilot was given his choice of runways. \"Which one would you recommend,\" the pilot asked. \"One seven will take me down to Blue Mesa, won't it?\"  When he was told it would, the pilot taxied to runway 17L and advised the control tower that he had ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) Zulu and would need to do an engine runup. At 0712, he asked if there were any pilot reports, and was told that one pilot reported encountering no ice during climbout and that the cloud tops were at 7,200 feet. At 0717, the pilot was cleared for takeoff, but reduced visibility prevented control tower personnel from observing the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0719:27, the pilot said, \"Whiskey Charlie, lookin' for higher.\"  (According to the tower controller's statement, he had been watching the BRITE radar for the airplane's data tag to appear and when the pilot asked for a higher altitude, he observed a primary target, then a limited data tag, northbound and east of runway 17L). The controller asked the pilot for his heading, and he replied, \"Whiskey Charlie, apologi . . .\" He was then instructed to fly a heading of 170 degrees and to contact departure control. The pilot never responded. When it was determined that radio and radar contact had been lost with the airplane, the runway was closed and departures were temporarily suspended. The tower controller told the radar controller, \"[Visibility is a] quarter mile. We cannot see the runway . . .we heard a noise . . . we heard the airplane.\" Another controller said she \"heard a noise and felt a movement or 'thud' in the tower.\" At 0736, an airport maintenance vehicle reported he was investigating a report of smoke south of the airport. At 0740, the airport maintenance vehicle confirmed the airplane was down  approximately 1/4-mile south of runways 10-28.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 49, held a private pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings. He also held a first class airman medical certificate, dated March 11, 1999, with no limitations or restrictions. His logbook, which was recovered from the wreckage, contained entries from August 23, 1995, (when the pilot took his first instructional flight), to January 21, 2001 (the last recorded entry). According to the logbook, the pilot received his private pilot license and instrument rating on August 14, 1998. The airplane's flight time logbook was also recovered from the wreckage. Combining those entries made after January 21, 2001, with the entries made in the pilot's logbook, the following flight times were derived:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTotal time:  1,024 hrs.&#x0D;\nAirplane single-engine, land:  1,019.5 hrs.&#x0D;\nPilot-in-command:  719.4 hrs.&#x0D;\nInstruction received:  412.3 hrs.&#x0D;\nCross-country:  987.8 hrs.&#x0D;\nNight:  85.7 hrs.&#x0D;\nActual instruments:  94.3 hrs.&#x0D;\nSimulated instruments:  9.7 hrs.&#x0D;\nBy make/model: Cessna 150:  2.8 hrs.&#x0D;\n\t            Cessna 172:  8.5 hrs.&#x0D;\n                                  Piper PA-28-161:  3.2 hrs.&#x0D;\n\t             Piper PA-28R-201RT:  6.3 hrs.&#x0D;\n\t             Piper PA-46-350:  488.4 hrs.&#x0D;\n\t             Beech A36TC:  376.7 hrs.&#x0D;\n\t             Socata TBM-700:  136.3 hrs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's logbook also contained the following instrument proficiency checks, biennial flight reviews, and pilot proficiency endorsements:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNovember 7, 1998*# &#x0D;\n(given by an individual flight instructor)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNovember 22, 1998#&#x0D;\nRecurrent Training Center, Inc.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nJune 26, 1999+&#x0D;\n(given by an individual flight instructor)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMarch 20, 2000*#&#x0D;\n(given by an individual flight instructor)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAugust 25, 2000#+&#x0D;\nSIMCOM Training Center&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n* Biennial Flight Review, BFR [FAR 61.56(a)(1)(2)].&#x0D;\n# Instrument proficiency check (FAR 61.57).&#x0D;\n+ Pilot Proficiency Award Program (AC61-91H).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nN300WC (s/n 82), a model TBM-700, was manufactured by Socata Aircraft Company and was given an FAA standard airworthiness certificate, normal category, on February 15, 1993. It was equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-64 engine (s/n PS 111074), rated at 700 shaft horsepower, and a  Hartzell 4-blade composite, constant speed, full feathering propeller (m/n HC-E4N-3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the aircraft maintenance records, the last annual inspection was completed on February 9, 2001, at a Hobbs meter time (airframe and propeller) of 5,098.7 hours (engine total time 4,885.7 hours). The last static system, automatic pressure altitude reporting and transponder system checks were made on October 20, 2000, at a Hobbs meter time of 4,978.3 hours. At the accident site, the Hobbs meter read 5,139.0 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETAR (Aviation Routine Weather Report) observations recorded at Centennial Airport before and after the accident were as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0653: Wind, calm; visibility, 1/4 statute mile; freezing fog; vertical visibility, 100 feet; temperature,  -1 degree C.; dew point, -1 degree C.; altimeter setting, 30.02 in.; sea level pressure, 1019.5 mb.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0730:  Wind, calm; visibility, 1/8 statute mile; freezing fog; vertical visibility, 100 feet; temperature, -1 degree C.; dew point, -1 degree C.; altimeter setting, 30.02 in. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0753: Wind, calm; visibility, 1/4 statute mile; freezing fog; vertical visibility, 100 feet; temperature, -1 degree C.; dew point, -1 degree C.; altimeter setting, 30.03 in.; sea level pressure, 1019.7 mb.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAERODROME INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCentennial Airport (APA) is situated at an elevation of 5,883 feet msl (above mean sea level). The departure runway, 17L, is of asphalt construction, 10,002 feet long and 100 feet wide, and grooved. The runway is equipped with medium intensity runway lights (MIRL). They were operating at the time of takeoff. The airport also has a control tower, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS),  and an Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) that is operational 24 hours a day. At the time of departure, the rotating beacon was operating. The airport has several instrument approaches, including GPS (Global Positioning System), ILS (Instrument Landing System), NDB (Non-Directional Beacon), and VOR/DME RNAV (Very high frequency Omnidirectional Radio range/Distance Measuring Equipment aRea NAVigation). All of the instrument approaches were operational at the time of the accident. IFR arrivals and departures were being handled by Denver TRACON (terminal radar approach control).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe on-scene investigation commenced and concluded on March 26, 2001. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane first struck a newly planted pine tree (N39 degrees, 33.992', W104 degrees, 50.486'). Red lens fragments were found embedded in the bark approximately 5 feet above the ground. There was a faint ground scar from the tree leading up to the top of an embankment. There, 14 slashes were noted on the ground (N39 degrees, 33.993\", W104 degrees, 50.476\"). The distance between the first slash mark and second slash mark was 2 feet, 3 inches. Just beyond these marks was a small crater, aligned on a magnetic heading of 109 degrees, containing pieces identified as portions of the left wing tip fairing and the socket for a navigation light. At a point 6 feet beyond this crater was a large ground scar, containing a propeller blade tip (N39 degrees, 34.008', W104 degrees, 50.424'). This ground scar curved to the left from a magnetic heading of 082 degrees to 047 degrees. Indications of a flash fire encompassed approximately the last third of the first ground scar and  extended through the first half of the second ground scar. Forty-eight feet from the beginning of this second ground scar was the right wing. At the 210 foot mark, where the ground scar curved to a magnetic heading of 055 degrees, was the right aileron. The vertical stabilizer (N39 degrees, 34.019', W104 degrees, 50.400') and right main landing gear (N39 degrees, 34.023', W104 degrees, 50.397') were found near the end of the fire area. The ground scar then curved to a magnetic heading of 047 degrees and terminated at a large dirt embankment at the 489 foot mark. The top of the embankment was at a GPS (Global Positioning System) elevation of 5,817 feet. Ninety feet to the left was the left horizontal stabilizer and empennage (N39 degrees, 34.042', W104 degrees, 50.367', elevation of 5,654 feet). The empennage had separated at the aft pressure bulkhead splice. At the 717 foot mark, or 228 feet past the dirt embankment, was the left wing (N39 degrees, 34.049', W104 degrees, 50.353'). At the 1,059 foot mark, or 342 feet past the embankment, was the fuselage (N39 degrees, 34.052', W104 degrees, 50.315'). It lay on its left side on a magnetic heading of 215 degrees and at an elevation of 5,654 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the nose section, but the propeller assembly and hub separated from the engine and were found a short distance away (N39 degrees, 34.033', W104 degrees, 50.338'). All four propeller blades were curled aft midspan, and bore leading edge gouges and 90 degree chordwise scratches. The nose and main landing gears were against their uplocks, and the turnbuckle was turned in the retract position. The flaps were extended 10 degrees, which according to Socata Aircraft, is the takeoff setting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy (#AP01-75) and a toxicological screen were performed on the pilot at the request of the Arapahoe County Coroner. A toxicological screen (#200100077001) was also performed by FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI). Both tests yielded negative findings for carbon monoxide, alcohol, and drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCentennial Airport's lighting systems and radio navigational facilities were functionally checked shortly after the accident. They functioned satisfactorily.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe, engine, and avionics was conducted at the facilities of Beegles Aircraft Service, Inc., Greeley, Colorado, on March 29 and May 8 and 9, 2001. All major airframe components were accounted for and documented.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nElectrical power was applied to the airplane and all systems came on line. There was no electrical fire and, other than the aileron trim and flaps circuit breakers that were already open, no additional circuit breakers opened. The ESS BUS TIE was guarded in the NORMAL position. On the overhead panel, the voltmeter registered 26 volts (direct current), and the amp meter registered a slight discharge. The left and right landing and taxi, navigation, and strobe exterior lights were off. The turn coordinator, HSI/RMI, and ADI 2 switches were off. The radar altimeter switch was on. The battery, main generator, and starter switches were on, and the ignition switch was  in the AUTO position. On the instrument panel, the annunciator lights on the advisory panel tested normally. The fuel gauges registered empty, and the fuel pressure gauge needle was against the high end stop. The auxiliary boost pump and sequencer control were in the AUTO positions. Examination of the environmental control panel disclosed the bleed valve was ON/LOW, and the dump valve was still guarded. The altitude was 5,000 feet, the differential pressure was 0, and the rate of climb was 200 fpm up. The outflow valve controller was set to 4,500 feet cabin altitude and 22,000 feet aircraft altitude. The cabin temperature and defog rheostats were in the 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions, respectively. The airframe deice panel showed the ice light, propeller deice, left windshield heat, and inertial separator switches were on. The pitot 1, pitot 2, and stall heaters were on, but the switches were bent to the right. The airframe deice switch was off. The autopilot trim master switch was off, and the radio master switch was on. The instrument and panel light rheostats were dimmed, and the cabin and accessory switches were off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) disclosed the aircraft's heading was 120 degrees, the course selected was 130 degrees, and the heading selector bug was set 210 degrees (Centennial Airport's runway 17L is aligned on a magnetic heading of 167 degrees). The pilot's and copilot's altimeters registered 5,980 and 4,920 feet, and were set to 30.03 and 30.10 inches of mercury, respectively (the altimeter setting at the time of the accident was 30.02 inches of mercury). The radar altimeter registered 0 feet and the DH bug was set to 200 feet. The power lever and manual override were retarded; the propeller governor and condition lever were full forward. The landing gear was up, and the flaps were in the takeoff detent. The fuel selector was on the left tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe number 1 communications radio was tuned to 118.9 (active) and 120.3 (standby) mHz (these are the same frequencies for Centennial tower and ATIS, respectively). The number 2 communications radio was tuned to 132.75 (active) and 123.85 (standby) mHz (the former is the frequency for Denver departure control; the latter frequency was not identified). The number 1 navigation receiver was tuned to 117.9 mHz, which is the frequency for the Denver VORTAC. The number 2 navigation radio was tuned to 114.9 (active) and 111.3 (standby) mHz. The former is the frequency for the Blue Mesa VORTAC; the latter frequency was not identified. The ADF (automatic direction finder) was tuned to 260 kHz, which is the frequency as the Casse LOM (compass locator outer marker, associated with the ILS runway 35R instrument approach). The panel-mounted GPS was placarded, \"GPS approved for IFR en route, terminal, and non-precision approach operations.\" After downloading its memory, only en route navigational fixes were displayed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 15, 2001, the pitot-static system was tested. No anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe autopilot flight computer (KCP 220), autopilot mode controller (KMC 321), autopilot/flight director annunciator (KA 185A), air data computer (KDC 222), directional gyro/heading indicator (KG 102A), artificial horizon/attitude indicator (KI 256), horizontal situation indicator (KI 525A), and altitude/vertical speed preselect (KAS 297C) were removed and hand-carried to Honeywell Avionics in Olathe, Kansas, where, on June 19 and 20, 2001, they were functionally tested. All units tested satisfactorily. On August 16, the autopilot gyros and servos tested within specified limits.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 6, the hand-held GPSMAP 295 (that was found lying in the copilot's seat) was examined at Garmin International in Olathe. Stored data was downloaded and presented pictorially. The aircraft can be seen taxiing out of Jet Center's facility, turning right and proceeding north along taxiway Alpha. It then turns left onto runway 17L and takes off. Examination of the data revealed that at 0718:30, the airplane was heading 169 degrees at 103 mph. Twenty seconds later, the airplane began drifting to the left. The airplane made a climbing left turn, achieving a maximum altitude of 7,072 feet and completing 217 degrees of turn, before beginning a descending left turn. The last recorded position was at 39 degrees, 33.961 minutes north latitude, and 104 degrees, 50.554 minutes west longitude. The last recorded data was at 0719:44 when the airplane was at 5,717 feet, heading 084 degrees at a ground speed of 198 mph.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNTAP (National Track Analysis Program) radar data was retrieved from the Denver TRACON. The first radar contact was at 0718:38.69, when the airplane was in a climbing left turn at an encoded altitude of 5,800 feet and at a ground speed of 109 knots. The data showed the airplane achieving a maximum encoded altitude of 7,000 feet before entering a descending left turn.  The last recorded contact was at 0719:38.62 when the airplane was at 6,700 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Airplane Flight Manual, a constant 2,000 rpm is used for takeoff and climb. Using the distance between the first two slash marks found at the accident site, a rough estimate of ground speed at impact was computed by using the following formula:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround speed (knots) = rpm x distance between strike marks (in feet) x number of propeller blades/101&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTherefore,                       = 2,000 x 2.2 x 4/101&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOr,                                      = 17,600/101&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n                                            = 174 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was found lying in the aft portion of the cabin. His shoulder harness was found attached to the seatbelt, but the male end of the seatbelt buckle was broken. The seatbelt, type 343 1, was manufactured by Anjou Aeronautique S.A. of Tierce, France, and was FAA approved under TSO C22f. The seatbelts on the remaining four seats were tested using the following protocol: After buckling the seatbelt, the short end of the belt was anchored and the long end was given a sharp yank to simulate an impact. Each and every seatbelt buckle snapped open. A visit was made to a local Socata repair facility. Several TBM-700s were in the hangar. An early model and a late model TBM-700 were selected at random. Several of the seatbelts were subjected to this same test previously mentioned. All of the seatbelts snapped open. A similar seatbelt installed in a Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma helicopter was tested and it, too, snapped open.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition to the Federal Aviation Administration, parties to the investigation were Socata Aircraft, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Honeywell, and Technical Leasing, Inc.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was released to Technical Leasing's chief pilot on October 15, 2001. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airplane was damaged when it impacted the ground while performing a GPS approach in instrument weather conditions. The aircraft was on the third GPS approach attempt when the accident occurred.  The pilot said that the runway, \"...was sighted at about 3/4 of mile and [at] MDA.  The [runway] lights were in sight and I had a good clear view of the [runway]... Everything looked fine visually until just before the accident. As we neared the [runway] it became apparent that the [runway] was rising in the window. I added power to stop the descent, however, there was a significant delay (much longer than normal) in the response of the engine.  The engine finally spooled and at that moment a gust lifted the right wing and the left wing dropped, I corrected but there was not enough altitude and the left wing impacted the ground.\"  The pilot said that he, \"... had logged the engine parameters on this flight since the engine just had a compressor wash and everything indicated the engine was performing, as it should.\"  The minimum descent altitude for the approach is 364 feet above the elevation of the airport. The Automated Weather Observing System at the destination airport recorded the sky condition as 200 feet overcast with a visibility of 1 1/2 statute miles.

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 15, 2000, at 0545 central standard time (cst), a Socata TBM 700, N45PM, piloted by a private pilot, sustained substantial damage when it impacted terrain near Harrisburg, Illinois.  The aircraft was on the GPS RWY 24 approach to the Harrisburg-Raliegh Airport (HSB), Harrisburg, Illinois.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan and instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The pilot and one passenger reported no injuries; two passengers reported minor injuries.  The flight originated from the Winder-Barrow Airport (WDR), Winder, Georgia at 0500 eastern standard time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he was performing his third approach to the airport.  He said that the first two attempts were for the GPS runway 24 approach to HSB and that these attempts ended in missed approaches.  He said that, during each of the first two approaches, there was, \"... good ground contact moving closer to the [runway].\"  The third attempt was also a GPS runway 24 approach.  The pilot said that the runway, \"...was sighted at about 3/4 of mile and [at] MDA.  The [runway] lights were in sight and I had a good clear view of the [runway]. In fact the lights illuminated the [runway] quite well against the backdrop of white snow and the cloud layer above.\"  The pilot said, \"Everything looked fine visually until just before the accident. As we neared the [runway] it became apparent that the [runway] was rising in the window. I added power to stop the descent, however, there was a significant delay (much longer than normal) in the response of the engine.  The engine finally spooled and at that moment a gust lifted the right wing and the left wing dropped, I corrected but there was not enough altitude and the left wing impacted the ground.\"  The pilot said that he, \"... had logged the engine parameters on this flight since the engine just had a compressor wash and everything indicated the engine was performing, as it should.\"  The pilot also stated that the runway end identifier lights (REIL) were not working.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a written statement, the HSB airport manager said that the REIL system was functioning properly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe automated weather observing system located at HSB recorded the weather at 0555 cst as: Winds 080 degrees magnetic at 3 knots; Visibility 1 1/2 statute miles; Sky condition 200 feet overcast; Temperature 25 degrees Fahrenheit; Dewpoint 25 degrees Fahrenheit; Altimeter setting 30.42 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument approach chart for the GPS RWY 24 approach at HSB lists the minimum descent altitude as 760 feet MSL.  The field elevation at HSB is 396 feet MSL.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the aircraft failed to reveal any anomalies that could be associated with a preexisting condition. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On March 13, 1999, about 1255 Eastern Standard Time, a Socata TBM 700, N700SP, was substantially damaged during a landing at the Winchester Regional Airport, Winchester, Virginia.  The certificated private pilot and passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that originated from Montreal Dorval International Airport, Montreal, Canada.  An instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he landed the airplane with the landing gear retracted.  He flew a downwind, base, and final leg for Runway 32.  While in the traffic pattern, he was preoccupied with an airplane on an instrument approach, and an airplane that had just landed on the runway.  The pilot was discussing the traffic with the passenger, and did not remember hearing an audible warning for the landing gear.  However, he believed that the audible warning system was working properly.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA local mechanic witnessed the landing.  He stated that the airplane flew approximately 100 feet above the runway threshold, landed approximately 600 feet beyond the approach end, and slid approximately 1,400 feet.  The airplane came to rest on the runway, to the right of the centerline.  The flaps, propeller, and wings sustained damaged.  After the accident, the mechanic approached the airplane and observed the gear lever in the \"UP\" position.  The airplane was brought to a hanger and placed on a lift.  The power was turned \"ON\" and the audible warning sounded immediately.  The gear lever was then placed in the \"DOWN\" position.  The gear extended, the three green gear lights illuminated, and the warning horn ceased.  The mechanic further stated that four different events; stall, autopilot disengage, gear retracted while the flaps are extended, and radar altimeter alert, activate the same audible warning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following is an excerpt from the TBM 700 Maintenance Manual:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"buzzer LS7 (Altitude preselect indication) buzzer LS8 (Auto Pilot disconnect indication) buzzer LS6 (VMP warning)...&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLDG up and throttle reduced -------------------&gt;  high-pitch sound LDG up and flap down----------------------------&gt;  high-pitch sound Stall-----------------------------------------------------&gt;  low-pitch sound         LDG up, throttle reduced and stall------------&gt;  alternate high-low pitch sounds LDG up, flaps down and stall-------------------&gt;  alternate high-low pitch sounds\" -",

The witnesses, one of which was a commercial pilot said that there were jagged ceilings at the time about 400 to 500 feet above the ground.  He and two other men with him saw the airplane below the clouds.  As the airplane proceeded downwind, it momentarily entered a cloud.  As the airplane came out of the cloud, it turned left in about a 30 degree turn.  The angle of bank increased to about 70 to 80 degrees, the tail of the airplane came up, and the airplane impacted the ground nose first.  Several pilots at the airport heard someone from N69BS make a radio transmission on the UNICOM frequency.  What was heard by several people was that N69BS had broken out at 2200 feet.  They then heard, 'N69BS turning base,' immediately followed by 'lookout' and 'oh ....'  All of the eye witnesses agreed that at no time did they see or hear any problems with the engine.  They all said that the sounds coming from the engine never changed.  The published approach in use at the time of the accident was the GPS (global positioning system) runway 12.   The pilot made his initial approach to runway 12, broke off the approach to the right, entered a right downwind for a landing on runway 30.  The published circling minimums for the approach were MDA (minimum descent altitude) 4,800 feet, HAT (height above terrain) 869 feet. Using an approach speed of 90 knots, the minimum visibility was 1 mile. Using an approach speed of 120 knots, the minimum visibility was 1 1/4 miles.  The field elevation was 3,931 feet. The profile for the GPS runway 12 approach showed that after the IAF (Jesee way point), the course was 204 degrees, at 7,000 feet, to the Dezzi way point, from Dezzi the course was 114 degrees, descend to 5,600, to Sophi way point, after Sophi descend to 4,800 feet to the missed approach point at the Ruste way point.

Marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported, and an IFR flight plan was filed.  The airplane was destroyed.  The private-rated pilot-in-command, a commercial-rated pilot/passenger, a private-rated pilot/passenger, and one passenger were fatally injured.  The flight had originated at an unknown time, the same day, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, en route to Spearfish, and had made a refueling stop at Madison, Wisconsin.  The flight departed Madison at 1146 CDT [1046 MST].&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tWitnesses observed the flight enter downwind for runway 30, after it had completed a published approach to runway 12, with a circle to land on runway 30.

They all said that the sounds coming from the engine never changed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe accident occurred during the hours of daylight approximately 44 degrees, 29 minutes north, and 103 degrees, 47 minutes west.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tInformation on the pilot is contained in this report on page 3, under First Pilot Information.   The pilot's personal log book listing his flight hours was not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tMeteorological information is contained in this report on page 3, under Weather Information.  At the time of the accident the winds were reported to be calm, and the lowest ceiling was broken at 2,200 feet.  Witnesses reported a jagged ceiling, mist and fog in the area. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAn autopsy was performed on the pilot, on August 5, 1998, at the Medical Examiner's Office, Clinical Laboratory of the Black Hills, Rapid City, South Dakota, by Dr. Donald M. Habbe.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tToxicological tests were conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration, Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and revealed, \"No ethanol or drugs detected in Blood.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAll communication with the flight were routine.  At 1311:36, the pilot of N69BS made radio contact with the controller at Ellsworth Approach Control (APCH), Ellsworth Air Force Base, Rapid City, South Dakota.  The flight reported in on frequency at an altitude of 17,900 feet descending to 17,000 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1312:03, the APCH controller said, \"...[N69BS] no weather or traffic advisory available for the Spearfish airport...you can get Spearfish weather on one eight point three two five.\"  The pilot said he was getting the frequency \"intermittently now\" and thanked the controller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe controller asked the pilot, what his intentions were at Spearfish, and the pilot answered, \"...we'll do the visual in there if we can.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1313:00, the controller said, \"...we've had traffic trying to get in there all day, we just had a Mooney trying to get in there...V-F-R and could not get into the airfield V-F-R.\"  The pilot said, \"...we'll do the N-D-B [non-directional beacon] or the G-P-S (difficult to read) A [global positioning system] to it.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe controller told the pilot that the \"Rapid City N-D-B\" was out, and pilot said, \"(laugh), looking good today huh?  Down here. OK we'll find Jesee [way point, initial approach fix/IAF] hang on a minute.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1313:32, the APCH controller said, \"...correction, the Spearfish N-D-B is out.\"  The pilot of N69BS answered \"affirmative.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe pilot was given a clearance to \"descend at pilots discretion, maintain one zero thousand [10,000 feet]...fly heading two nine five [295 degrees], Spearfish.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1326:06, the APCH controller said, \"...attention all aircraft, attention all aircraft, Ellsworth RADAR is out of service.  I say again, Ellsworth RADAR is out of service.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1333:00, the controller asked the pilot of N69BS to \"say position.\"  The pilot replied, \"..sixteen and a half south east of Jesse.\"   The controller said, \"...verify  six miles North East of Spearfish airport, level at one zero thousand.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe pilot said, \"...OK give you call six east of Spearfish airport at one zero thousand.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1333:20, the APCH controller said, \"Sir, verify that is your position now.  I show you six northeast of Spearfish level at one zero thousand, code [transponder] one zero seven, ident.\"  The pilot acknowledged the \"ident,\" and said, \"...position again for you is one four point six east of Jesee.\"  The controller then said to the pilot \"...roger, Jesee is not depicted on my RADAR sir, I need your position off Spearfish.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1333:55, the control said to the pilot of N69BS, \"...disregard, turn right three zero degrees for RADAR identification.\"  The pilot acknowledges the controller request, and at 1335:50, the pilot said, \"...right now [the flight] is seven point four north of Spearfish.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe controller told the pilot to report Jesee for G-P-S runway one two Spearfish airport, and the pilot acknowledged the clearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1340:30, there was a change of controllers at Ellsworth APCH, and the pilot of N69BS said his position was \"two and one half [miles] from Jesee at one zero thousand looking for lower.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe pilot was given the following clearance at 1340:35, \"...cross the initial approach fix [Jesee] at or above one zero thousand, cleared G-P-S approach into Spearfish airport, report procedure turn inbound.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1342:50, the pilot said, \"...k, give you a call at Jesee...and...coming up on Sophi [final approach fix, FAF].\"  The controller said, \"...roger report procedure turn inbound.\"  The pilot said, \"...we are inbound.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAt 1343:13, the controller said, \"...RADAR service terminated, change to advisory, report your down time this frequency or with Huron Flight Service Station.\"  The pilot said \"will do,\" and that was the last transmission from N69BS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAERODROME AND GROUND FACILITIES&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe published approach in use at the time of the accident was the GPS runway 12.   The pilot made his initial approach to runway 12, broke off the approach to the right, entered a right downwind for a landing on runway 30.  The published circling minimums for the approach were MDA (minimum descent altitude) 4,800 feet, HAT (height above terrain) 869 feet.  Using an approach speed of 90 knots, the minimum visibility was 1 mile. Using an approach speed of 120 knots, the minimum visibility was 1 1/4 miles.  The field elevation was 3,931 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe profile for the GPS runway 12 approach showed that after the IAF (Jesee way point), the course was 204 degrees, at 7,000 feet, to the Dezzi way point, from Dezzi the course was 114 degrees, descend to 5,600, to Sophi way point, after Sophi descend to 4,800 feet to the missed approach point at the Ruste way point.  The distance from Dezzi to Ruste was 10 miles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe airplane impacted in a open field, on the right downwind leg for runway 30, about 1 1/2 miles southeast of the airport.  Impact craters from the landing gear, the engine, and the left wing were found about 30 feet south of the wreckage.  The crater attributed to the engine was about 1 foot deep, and one of the propeller blades was found in the crater.  The crater was oriented south to north and on the west side of the crater was an impact mark consistent with the left wing.  The airplane traveled about 30 feet from the crater, in a northerly direction, coming to rest with the nose of the airplane heading 278 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe left wing displayed impact damage along the entire length of the wing.  The right wing showed very little impact damage.  The right wing displayed extensive fire damage inboard around the fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe flaps were found extended in the takeoff position.  The floating nut was found 4 inches from the rear bearing grove.  Control continuity was established to all the flight controls, to include aileron, elevator, and rudder trims.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAll three landing gear were found in the down and locked position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe airplane's cabin area was completely destroyed by the post-impact fire, rendering all the instruments and switch unreadable, and no information was obtained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tTwo sections of elevator trim cable were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C. for examination.  For identification the two pieces of cable were marked \"a\" and \"b.\"  The NTSB Materials Laboratory Factual Report is attached to this report.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tAccording to the laboratory factual report the longer piece of cable was marked as \"a\" and examination revealed that it had sooting and melting along its length, \"consistent with fire damage.\"   The cable also showed signs of \"corrosion.\"  The splayed end had been damaged by heat and fire, \"so no signs of pre-existing damage or cracking could be seen.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe examination of cable \"b\" revealed that it was oxidized, but showed only minimal sooting at the separated end.  The splayed wires revealed that some had a reduced cross section, or necking, at the point of separation.  According to the NTSB Materials Laboratory Factual Report, \"...the splaying of the cable, along with the necking and shear fractures in the wire, is consistent with an overstress separation.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe engine was removed from the crash site and taken to Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, Service Investigation Facilities, at St. Hubert, Quebec, Canada.  The engine was examined on November 18, 1998, under the supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe detailed results of the engine examination can be found in the Pratt &amp; Whitney factual report which is an attachment to this report.  All position references are in relation to a view from aft looking forward.  Upstream and downstream references are in relation to the gas path flow from the compressor inlet to exhaust.  The engine displayed impact damage and some post impact fire damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe engine was disassembled and revealed circumferential rubbing and scoring by the compressor turbine vane ring, compressor turbine, first stage power turbine vane ring, first stage power turbine, second stage power turbine vane ring, and the second stage power turbine, due to their making axial contact with their adjacent components under impact loads and external housing distortion.  The compressor blades and shroud, compressor turbine blades and shroud, the first and second stage power turbine blades and shroud displayed strong circumferential rubbing and scoring due to their making radial contact under impact loads and external housing distortion.  The disassembly of the engine did not reveal any discrepancies.  Based on the contact signatures to the internal components of the engine it was determined that the engine was developing power at impact, most likely in the middle to low power range. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\tThe airplane was released to Mr. Will Lantis, the land owner, on August 6, 1998.  At the time the airplane was released there was no representative of the owner present.  The engine was released to Pratt &amp; Whitney for shipment as per Peter Guy, Claims Adjuster, for the owner's Insurance Company, on November 18, 1998. -",

As he turned for the base leg, he lost visual contact and became disoriented.  It was a dark night with no moon.  The pilot realized that he was in a 70- to 80-degree left bank and returned the airplane to a level attitude, then noticed the ground directly in front of him.  The aircraft ran through a barbed wire fence, collided with trees, and slid rearward to a stop in a high altitude meadow east of the airport.

    "FactualNarrative": "On March 13, 1998, about 1900 hours Pacific standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N345RD, collided with terrain about 0.5 miles east of the Truckee, California, airport.  The airplane was destroyed, and the commercial pilot and three passengers received minor injuries.  The airplane was being operated as a personal flight by the pilot/owner.  The flight originated from Gnoss Field in Novota, California, at 1800.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Truckee Airport was reporting visual meteorological conditions with 10 miles visibility and a 1,700-foot agl overcast ceiling.  The pilot was cleared by Oakland Center Approach Control for a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach to runway 19.  He reported that there was a bluff near runway 19 with housing on it, which made him uncomfortable, so he delayed his descent to the minimum descent altitude (MDA).  When he did descend, he felt that he was too high too make a good landing on the runway so he opted instead to perform a circling approach to runway 28.  The pilot stated that as he initiated a left turn for the base leg of runway 28, he became preoccupied with maintaining visual contact with the airport.  It was a dark night with no moon.  The pilot reported that he soon lost visual contact and became disoriented.  The attitude indicator showed the aircraft to be in a 70- to 80-degree left bank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the pilot returned the airplane to a straight and level attitude, he noticed the ground directly in front of him.  The aircraft ran through a barbed wire fence, collided with trees, and slid rearward to a stop in a high altitude meadow east of the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Flight Inspection Field Office in Sacramento, California, conducted an evaluation of the GPS approach for runway 19 with circle to land minimums at night for all categories, the elevation differential around the airport, and overall night operations at the Truckee Airport.  They reported that they did not find any problems with the approach. -",
