    "PrelimNarrative": "On April 7, 2023, about 1655 Pacific daylight time, a Compagnie Daher TBM 700 airplane (marketed as a TBM 940), N6924G, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Ashland Municipal Airport-Sumner Parker Field (S03), Ashland, OR. The pilot and pilot rated passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported he was 2.5 hours into a flight review in the accident airplane. The instructor gave the pilot a flight scenario that included a weather diversion to Ashland, Oregon. As the airplane approached the airport, the pilot established that the winds favored Runway 30. The pilot lowered the landing gear and extended his downwind leg in the pattern to assure a stabilized approach. He confirmed that the landing gear was down, full flaps were extended, and his approach speed was between 80 to 95 knots, with an engine torque greater than 10%.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the final approach leg was uneventful. After he crossed the pavement of Runway 30, the instructor announced to the pilot that there was a simulated obstruction on the runway and that he should perform a go-around.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot advanced engine power to 70% torque and established the airplane in a level flight attitude. He expected to see an increase in airspeed; however, almost immediately the airplane yawed to the left of the runway centerline. He depressed the right rudder but was unable to correct the movement. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane continued to lose altitude and impacted the left side of the runway in a level attitude and came to rest after it encountered bushes and small trees near the edge of a creek. The pilot side door was obstructed by sizable tree branches and the two pilots exited the passenger door. A small fire ensued eventually engulfing much of the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom the moment that the pilot increased power to terrain impact was approximately 3 to 5 seconds. &#x0D;\nThe pilot had accumulated about 2,650 hours as PIC, with 1400 hours in a TBM. He reported he had performed a go-around many times with and without instructors. There was never a stall warning indicator or any indication of impending loss of control.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was performing a short cross-country flight, which was his third solo flight in the high-performance single-engine airplane. The airplane departed and climbed to 20,000 ft mean sea level (msl) before beginning to descend. About 8 minutes before the accident, the airplane was southbound, descending to 11,000 ft, and the pilot established communications with air traffic control (ATC). About 4 minutes later, the controller cleared the pilot to descend to 10,000 ft msl and proceed direct to his destination; the pilot acknowledged the clearance. &#x0D;\nWhile descending through 13,000 ft msl, the airplane entered a descending left turn. The controller observed the left turn and asked the pilot if everything was alright; there was no response from the pilot. The controller’s further attempts to establish communications were unsuccessful. Following the descending left turn, the airplane entered a high speed, nose-down descent toward terrain. A witness observed the airplane at a high altitude in a steep nose-down descent toward the terrain. The witness noted no signs of distress, such as smoke, fire, or parts coming off the airplane, and he heard the airplane’s engine operating at full throttle. The airplane impacted two powerlines, trees, and the terrain in a shallow descent with a slightly left-wing low attitude.&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed a long debris field that was consistent with an impact at a high speed and relatively shallow flightpath angle. All major components of the airplane were located in the debris field at the accident site. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nA performance study indicated the airplane entered a left roll and dive during which the airplane exceeded the airspeed, load factor, and bank angle limitations published in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). An important but unknown factor during these maneuvers was the behavior of the pilot and his activity on the flight controls during the initial roll and dive. The pilot responded normally to ATC communications only 98 seconds before the left roll started. It is difficult to reconcile an alert and attentive pilot with the roll and descent that occurred, but there is insufficient information available to determine whether the pilot was incapacitated or distracted during any part of the roll and dive maneuver.&#x0D;\nAlthough all the available toxicological specimens contained ethanol (the alcohol contained in alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine), the levels were very low and below the allowable level for flight (0.04 gm/dl). While it is possible that some of the identified ethanol had been ingested, it is also possible that all or most of the identified ethanol was from sources other than ingestion (such as postmortem production). In either case, the levels were too low to have caused incapacitation. It is therefore unlikely that any effects from ethanol contributed to the circumstances of the accident. There was minimal available autopsy evidence to support any determination of incapacitation. As a result, it could not be determined from the available evidence whether medical incapacitation contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Airplane Performance Study&#x0D;\nAn Aircraft Performance and Simulation Study was completed by the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering. The study was based on ATC data, Garmin GTN 750 GPS device data, wreckage location and debris field evidence, weather information, airplane performance information from the POH, and output from aircraft performance analysis programs and simulations. The airplane was not equipped (and was not required to be equipped) with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder. No measures of the flight control inputs or engine power during the flight were available. However, the Garmin GTN 750 recorded many performance parameters, including altitude, position, ground speed and airspeed, Euler angles (heading, pitch, and roll), and vertical and lateral load factors. This information was used to define the trajectory of the airplane during its descent from 20,000 ft msl and sudden left turn and dive as it descended through 13,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\nThe airplane began its descent about 1433:00, while flying at 183 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) about 25 nautical miles (nm) north and 7 nm east of the accident site. The descent rate was relatively constant, about -1,600 ft/minute (ft/min), varying between -1,500 and -1,700 ft/min with oscillations between -1,150 and -1,850 ft/min during turns. During the descent, the airspeed increased to 200 KCAS at 1435:00, and then at 1435:40 increased further, reaching 235 KCAS at 1438:20 and 13,000 ft msl, just before the start of the left roll and final dive. Turns during the descent were consistent with the autopilot roll authority limits of 25° roll angle and 5°/second roll rate.&#x0D;\nThe position data recorded by the GTN 750 was consistent with recorded automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and radar data. For unexplained reasons, there were periodic 14 to 16 second gaps in the ADS-B data every 4 to 5 minutes during the flight, and the ADS-B data stopped entirely at 1437:28, about 83 seconds before the end of the GTN 750 data, as the airplane was descending through 14,100 ft msl, about 4.9 nm north of the accident site. The reason for the lapses in the ADS-B data is unknown.&#x0D;\nAt 1436:42, 98 seconds before the start of the final roll and dive, as the airplane was descending through 15,300 ft msl about 8 nm north of the accident site, the pilot made a final radio transmission to ATC. The content of the communication was appropriate and unremarkable.&#x0D;\nAt 1438:20.5, the airplane started rolling left about 7°/second (faster than the autopilot authority). The airplane continued rolling left at this rate until the roll angle reached about 110° left wing down, when the roll rate momentarily dropped back to zero. The roll angle then started to return towards wings-level, reaching 62° left wing down at 1438:49.7, and then remained relatively constant until the end of the GTN 750 data at 1438:51.7. During the roll maneuver, the pitch angle decreased from about 4.5° nose down at 14:38:20 to 31.5° nose down at 14:38:37, and it continued to decrease even as the roll angle lessened, reaching 53° nose down as the roll angle was returning through 80° left wing down. Thereafter the pitch angle started to increase, reaching 45° nose down at the end of the data.&#x0D;\nThe GTN 750 data ends at an altitude of about 4,200 ft msl, or 3,200 ft above the terrain elevation of about 1,000 ft msl. At the end of the data, the descent rate was about 30,000 ft/min but was apparently decreasing. The airplane was about 1 nm away from the impact location when the data ended, and simulations indicated that it would have taken about another 11 seconds to cover that distance. According to the NTSB GPS devices specialist, it is very common for the data recorded in avionics devices to end before impact because of the buffering process used in writing the data to storage media; the data loss can range from a few seconds up to a minute.&#x0D;\nThree different simulation scenarios were evaluated in the performance study, titled Controls, Imbalance, and Recovery. The Controls and Imbalance scenarios simulated the initial roll and dive up to the end of the GTN 750 data (from 1438:06 to 1438:52). The Recovery scenario continued the simulation past the end of the data and attempted to determine the flight control inputs that would result in the airplane arriving at the initial impact point in an attitude consistent with the accident site evidence.&#x0D;\nThe Controls scenario was performed using a symmetrical airplane loading (center of gravity on the airplane centerline). Based on the results, which showed very little yoke and wheel force required during the initial roll and dive, the Imbalance and Recovery scenarios were performed assuming a 420-pound (lb) fuel imbalance (left wing heavier). This imbalance resulted in a match of the initial roll when zero-wheel force was applied and simulated a situation in which the autopilot was holding wheel force against the fuel imbalance until 1438:20.5, but then disconnected for some reason. Assuming that the pilot did not intervene, the wheel force after the autopilot disconnect remained zero.&#x0D;\nThe Recovery scenario provided an estimate of performance parameters beyond the end of the GTN 750 data that were consistent with the final recorded data points and with the airplane heading, bank angle, and flight path angle evidenced by the impact point and long debris path. The scenario indicated that substantial wheel and column forces were required to maneuver the airplane from the state indicated by the end of the GTN 750 data to the impact point. &#x0D;\nThe Recovery scenario also indicated that the initial part of the maneuver could be approximately duplicated with zero control forces applied, together with either an aerodynamic or loading asymmetry and a disengaged autopilot. The low control forces required and irregularity of the maneuver itself suggested that the pilot might have been momentarily incapacitated or distracted between 1438:21 and 1438:37. However, the simulations also indicated that the pilot would have had to apply substantial wheel and column forces after 1438:37 to maneuver the airplane to the accident site. &#x0D;\nA turbulence encounter that produced a normal load factor of more than 1.6 Gs could have disengaged the autopilot. The GTN 750 data indicated that such an encounter might have occurred before the start of the left roll at 1438:20.5. If the autopilot was holding wheel force against a 420 pound fuel imbalance at the time it disconnected, a roll rate matching that recorded in the data would develop, unless the pilot intervened by applying force on the control wheel. A 420 pound fuel imbalance could result from burning fuel from only one tank for about 1.1 hours in cruise flight. &#x0D;\nIn the accident, an important but unknown factor was the behavior of the pilot and his activity (or lack thereof) on the flight controls during the initial roll and dive. Notably, the pilot responded normally to an ATC communication at 1436:42, only 98 seconds before the roll rate started to increase at 1438:20.5. However, it is difficult to reconcile an alert and attentive pilot with the roll and descent that followed. There was insufficient information available to determine whether a fuel asymmetry was present or whether the pilot was incapacitated or distracted for at least part of the roll and dive maneuver. - On August 6, 2021, maintenance personnel completed an “A+ inspection” and an annual inspection on the airframe, engine, and propeller in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance program. On August 19, 2021, at the request of the pilot, the pilot’s local maintenance company contracted with an FAA certified engine repair station to complete a borescope inspection of the engine’s turbine section. No defects were noted during the borescope inspection.&#x0D;\nAccording to flight tracking data and an associate, the pilot last refueled the airplane in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 14, 2021. After the refueling and before the accident flight, the pilot conducted two flights totaling about 1.5 hours. The amount of fuel remaining in each fuel tank after these flights was unknown. - On August 20, 2021, about 1440 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700A airplane, N700DT, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Urbana, Ohio. The pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nATC information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated the airplane was en route from the Erie-Ottawa Airport (PCW), Port Clinton, Ohio, to the Cincinnati Municipal Airport (LUK), Cincinnati, Ohio. At 1412, the airplane departed runway 9 at PCW and climbed to 20,000 ft msl before beginning to descend. At 1432, the airplane was southbound, descending to 11,000 ft msl, and the pilot established communications with the assigned terminal radar approach control controller. &#x0D;\nAbout 1436, the controller cleared the pilot to descend to 10,000 ft msl and proceed direct to LUK. The pilot acknowledged the clearance, and about 98 seconds later, while descending through 13,000 ft msl, the airplane entered a left turn. At 1438, the controller observed the left turn and asked the pilot if everything was alright; there was no response from the pilot. Radar contact was subsequently lost with the airplane, and the controller’s further attempts to establish communications were unsuccessful.&#x0D;\nA witness located about 2 miles south of the accident location stated that he observed the airplane at a high altitude in a nose-dive descent toward the terrain. He reported the airplane was not turning or spinning; it was headed straight down. The witness observed no signs of distress, such as smoke, fire, or parts coming off the airplane, and he stated the airplane’s engine was at full throttle. The witness lost sight of the airplane as it descended behind some trees.&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located 1.3 miles northwest of the last radar contact, and on scene evidence indicated the airplane impacted two powerlines, trees, and the terrain in a shallow descent with a slightly left-wing low attitude. (See figures 1 and 2.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident site and initial impact point - According to the autopsy report issued by the Coroner of Montgomery County, Ohio, the pilot’s cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. The examination was significantly limited by the extent of injury; the brain and heart were not available for examination.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified ethanol at 0.018 gm/dl in cavity blood; 0.010 mg/hg in liver; and 0.020 mg/hg in lung. No other tested for substances were detected. &#x0D;\nEthanol is a social drug commonly consumed by drinking beer, wine, or liquor. It acts as a central nervous system depressant; it impairs judgement, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance. Ethanol is water soluble, and after absorption it quickly and uniformly distributes throughout the body’s tissues and fluids. The distribution pattern parallels water content and blood supply of the tissue. Ethanol may be produced by body tissues after death by microbial activity (postmortem production). Extensive trauma increases the spread of bacteria and raises the risk of ethanol production after death. - No significant meteorological information, precipitation, or other forecast issues were reported in the area about the time of the accident. The reported weather included scattered cloud top levels were between 7,000 ft and 9,000 ft msl. - According to the pilot’s associates, he purchased the airplane about 9 days before the accident. Before the purchase, the pilot had owned and piloted Piper PA-46-310P/350P airplanes for about 20 years. &#x0D;\nAfter purchasing the airplane, the pilot and a flight instructor completed several hours of ground school and 15.5 hours of dual instruction in the airplane. The pilot and flight instructor had known each other for about 20 years and previously trained in the pilot’s Piper airplanes. The instructor stated the pilot was a “good student, in good health, and comfortable on the airplane’s systems.” The instructor advised the pilot to fly the airplane for about 10 to 15 hours by himself to get comfortable and not to fly in marginal weather.&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the pilot’s third solo flight in the airplane, and he had planned to pick up a family member at LUK. - The initial ground scar, located in a residential yard, contained separated components of the left wing. From the initial ground scar, a debris path continued across a highway, through trees and a ditch, and then continued into mature potato and soybean fields. The airplane wreckage, which was highly fragmented, was scattered over a distance of about 2,050 ft along a measured magnetic heading of 275°. An odor of Jet A aviation fuel was noted at the accident site by first responders.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit and fuselage were fragmented by impact forces. Flight control cable continuity could not be established due to the fragmentation of the airplane. All sections of the cables and push-pull tubes located in the wreckage exhibited tensile overload fractures. The primary and secondary flight control surfaces were fragmented and located in the debris field. The forward lower left fuselage skin displayed scrape marks consistent with contacting the highway road surface. The cabin and emergency doors were separated from the fuselage structure. The main cabin door locking pins were extended, and the door handle was in the closed position. The right main landing gear actuator was found locked in the UP position.&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory examined the light bulbs in the cockpit annunciator panel. The panel contained 30 individual annunciators, each of which contained 2 bulbs. One annunciator was missing from the panel. The individual annunciator lights were removed from the panel and x-rayed to determine the status of the filaments. None of the bulb filaments exhibited hot filament stretch. &#x0D;\nThe left wing was separated at the wing root and fragmented. The left flap and aileron were separated from the wing. The forward and rear spars of the left wing were bent aft from their original positions. The right wing was separated near the wing root and was fragmented into two sections. The right flap and aileron were separated from the wing. The flap jackscrew was found in the flaps UP position. The left and right horizontal stabilizers were separated, and the vertical stabilizer remained partially attached to the aft fuselage structure. The left elevator was separated; the right elevator remained partially attached; and the rudder remained attached to the vertical stabilizer. The rudder trim was found in a neutral position, and the elevator trim was about in the full nose up position.  &#x0D;\nThe engine accessory gearbox and forward propeller shaft were separated from the engine and located in the debris field. Multiple parts of the power turbine section and the compressor section exhibited rotational scoring. Multiple compressor impeller blades were bent opposite the direction of travel.&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub was separated from the engine propeller shaft. All five blades were separated from the hub, and a portion of each blade was found in the wreckage. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airplane was in cruise flight at FL280 when the instrument-rated pilot failed to contact air traffic control (ATC) following a frequency change assignment. After about 25 minutes, and when 30 miles east of the destination airport, the pilot contacted ATC on a frequency other than the one that was assigned. He requested the instrument landing system (ILS) approach at his intended destination, and the controller instructed the pilot to descend to 8,000 ft and to expect vectors for the ILS approach at the destination airport. The controller asked the pilot if everything was “okay,” to which the pilot replied, “yes sir, everything is fine.” The controller then observed the airplane initiate a descent. About 2 minutes later, the controller asked the pilot where he was headed, and the pilot provided a garbled response. The controller instructed the pilot to stop his descent at 10,000 ft, followed by an instruction to stop the descent at any altitude. The pilot did not respond, and additional attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. The airplane impacted terrain in a heavily wooded area 17 miles from the destination airport. &#x0D;\nAll major components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the main wreckage. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nThe investigation was unable to determine why the pilot was not in contact with ATC for 25 minutes. The pilot’s eventual contact with ATC about 30 miles from his intended destination, while still operating at his cruise altitude, suggests a clear breakdown in awareness of his position through distraction or impairment. However, upon re-establishing contact with ATC, the pilot’s communications were clear, nominal, and timely, which did not suggest impairment or use of an oxygen mask. Additionally, in response to a direct query from ATC the pilot did not indicate any difficulty. Further, there was no sign of airframe depressurization and examination of the wreckage did not reveal deployment of the passenger oxygen masks. Toxicology results were positive for ethanol at a low level, which was likely due to post-mortem production. &#x0D;\nMeteorological data and a performance study indicated that the pilot initiated a descent through multiple cloud layers about 15 seconds after acknowledging the descent clearance. During the initial portion of the airplane’s descent, its airspeed and rate of descent appeared to be nominal. About 2 minutes later, excessive airspeeds, descent rates, bank angles, and pitch attitudes were achieved. The performance study depicted the airplane entering a spiral dive during which the airplane exceeded airspeed, maneuvering, structural, and autopilot limitations. At 6,000 ft above ground level, and about 10 seconds before ground contact, the airplane descended through a final cloud layer, the descent profile shallowed, and the rate of descent decreased to 6,800 ft/min before radar data ended. &#x0D;\nIn addition, there were no clearances issued by ATC that would have required the pilot to change either the airplane’s rate of descent or track about this time; however, the airplane’s proximity to the destination airport may have created a heightened sense of urgency for the pilot to descend and or configure his avionics for the approach, which may have served as an operational distraction. Although it was possible that restrictions to visibility during the descent may have affected the pilot’s ability to maintain positive airplane control, there is insufficient information to determine how or why the pilot lost control.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Performance Study&#x0D;\nA performance study was conducted using airplane weight, radar, communications, and weather data. The results indicated the airplane was in cruise flight at 28,000 ft and about 190 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) until 1141:17, when over a 30-second span, the nose pitched down about 10° and the rate of descent increased to 4,500 ft/minute. The descent was initiated 15 seconds after the airplane was cleared to descend from its cruising altitude. The airplane maintained its assigned heading until 1143:31. At that time, the airplane descended through 19,300 ft and accelerated through its maximum operating speed of 271 KCAS. &#x0D;\nThe study showed that the airplane then entered a right banking turn that reached nearly 90°, with a pitch-down attitude of 47°. Both airspeed and rate of descent increased in the descending turn. Airspeed reached 350 KCAS and the rate of descent peaked at 28,400 ft/min at 1144:13, and then decreased to 6,800 ft/min at the end of the data. The computed normal load factor increased to about 3.8 G during the descent. The study noted the descent profile was consistent with a spiral dive.&#x0D;\nLimitations&#x0D;\nAccording to the manufacturer, the airplane autopilot engagement limitation for angle of bank was +/-45° and -15° for descending pitch angle. In addition, the autopilot operational envelope (commands limit) was +/- 25° for bank angle and -10° for descending pitch angle. Furthermore, the airplane was equipped with an emergency descent mode that, when engaged, would signal the autopilot to initiate a 90° left turn and descent up to 4,000 ft/min (depending on airplane loading, power lever positions, and weather conditions) until the airplane reached the target altitude of 15,000 ft msl. &#x0D;\n - According to FAA records, the pilot purchased the airplane in June 2016. It was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66D, 850-horsepower engine equipped with a Hartzell constant-speed propeller. &#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane flight manual, the airplane was equipped with an altimetric valve that provided an automatic passenger mask actuation function at a cabin altitude between 13,000 ft and 14,000 ft when the oxygen switch was set to ON.&#x0D;\n - On October 2, 2020, at 1144 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700, N965DM, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Corfu, New York. The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was serviced with 173 gallons of Jet A fuel on the morning of the accident, which filled the tanks. The first flight departed Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF), Buffalo, New York, at 0747 and landed at Manchester Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, at 0914, where the passenger was boarded. No services were received before the airplane departed on the accident flight.&#x0D;\nRadar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depicted its departure at 1019, and a climb to flight level (FL) 280 where it remained in level flight. Air traffic control (ATC) voice communication data revealed the pilot checked in with the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center following a frequency change issued by a previous controller, and about 25 minutes elapsed before the pilot established communication with Buffalo Approach Control when he was about 30 miles east of BUF.&#x0D;\nOn the initial contact, the pilot told the radar controller he had lost communication with center and was level at FL280. About 1141, the controller instructed him to descend to 8,000 ft and to expect the instrument landing system (ILS) runway 23 approach; radar data show the airplane began its descent about this time. A few seconds later, the controller asked the pilot if “everything was okay...” and the pilot responded, “yes sir, everything’s fine.” The controller then cleared the pilot to fly direct to BUF and to expect vectors for a left downwind t0 the runway 23 ILS. The pilot acknowledged this clearance. &#x0D;\nAbout 2 minutes later, the controller asked the pilot where he was headed, and the pilot provided a “garbled” response. The controller then instructed the pilot to stop his descent and to maintain 10,000 ft, followed by an instruction to stop his descent and to maintain any altitude. The pilot did not respond, and several additional attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. &#x0D;\nWitnesses in the area surrounding the crash site reported that the engine sound was “very loud” before the sound of impact was heard.&#x0D;\n - According to the autopsy report from the Office of the Medical Examiner, Monroe County, New York, the cause of the pilot’s death was multiple blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was accident. The examination was limited by the extensive injuries.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected ethanol in the pilot’s muscle tissue at 0.022 grams per hectogram (gm/hg). No other tested for drugs were detected in his muscle tissue. Toxicology testing performed for the medical examiner’s office was negative for ethanol and tested for drugs in the pilot’s muscle tissue. &#x0D;\nEthanol is a social drug commonly consumed by drinking beer, wine, or liquor. It acts as a central nervous system depressant; it impairs judgment, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance. Ethanol is water soluble, and after absorption it quickly and uniformly distributes throughout the body’s tissues and fluids. The distribution pattern parallels water content and blood supply of the tissue. Ethanol can be produced after death by microbial activity; sometimes in conjunction with other alcohols, such as propanol. Extensive trauma increases the spread of bacteria and raises the risk of ethanol production after death.&#x0D;\n - The 1154 recorded weather observation at BUF, located about 17 miles west of the accident location, included wind from 250° at 9 knots, visibility 10 miles, few clouds at 2,000 ft above ground level (agl) and 3,500 ft agl, broken cloud layers at 6,000 ft agl and 14,000 ft agl, temperature 13°C, dew point 8°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\nAccording to high-resolution rapid refresh model sounding for the accident site around 1200, the wind at FL190 was from the west about 25 knots. Relative humidity about FL190 was 33% and the relative humidity was above 90% for the entire atmosphere above about 9,000 ft. The freezing level was identified as about 5,200 ft. Calculations made by the Rawinsonde Observation Program (RAOB) did not identify any potential for icing, clouds, or significant turbulence between about 9,000 and 27,000 ft.&#x0D;\n - The pilot reported having flown 60 hours during the 6 months before his last FAA medical examination. The pilot’s logbook reflected a flight on May 20, 2019, and completion of a SimCom recurrent course for the TBM850 on February 9, 2020. A summary of the logbook review revealed the pilot’s hours of flight experience during the 4 years prior to the accident.&#x0D;\nYear&#x0D;\nTotal Flight Hours&#x0D;\nTBM Flight Hours&#x0D;\n2016&#x0D;\n100.2&#x0D;\n90.1&#x0D;\n2017&#x0D;\n53.9&#x0D;\n53.9&#x0D;\n2018&#x0D;\n70.1&#x0D;\n70.1&#x0D;\n2019&#x0D;\n25.1&#x0D;\n25.1&#x0D;\n - The airplane impacted a heavily wooded, swampy area. The airplane was fragmented and damaged by postcrash fire. Wreckage and components of the airplane were buried 15 ft below the surface. All of the major components were accounted for at the scene. An odor of Jet A aviation fuel was noted at the accident site by first responders.&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was fragmented by impact forces. The door locking pins on the main cabin door were extended and the door handle was in the closed position. A passenger emergency oxygen mask was located separated from the airframe, but the mask remained inside its housing. Control cable continuity could not be confirmed due to the fragmentation of the fuselage. All sections of the cables and push-pull tubes located exhibited tensile overload fractures. The autopilot aileron and trip servos were located, and all cables exhibited tensile overload failures. A majority of each primary and secondary flight control surfaces were in the fragmented wreckage. &#x0D;\nBoth the forward and aft sections of the center wing spar were bent symmetrically about 43° aft from their original positions. The left elevator trim tab was separated from the left elevator and located in four sections. The inboard section of the right elevator trim remained attached to the elevator. The elevator trim actuators were located and measured 16mm, consistent with a neutral position. The rudder was impact separated from the vertical stabilizer. The top section of the rudder and rudder trim tab were not located. The tailcone was impact separated and located in the wreckage. &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the accessory gearbox and inlet case were impact-separated, and they were not located. Multiple parts of the power turbine section and compressor section of the engine exhibited rotational scoring. Multiple blades were fractured, smeared, and bent the opposite direction of travel. The fracture surfaces that were not smeared exhibited features consistent with overload.&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub was impact-separated from the engine.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting an instrument approach at the conclusion of a cross-country flight when the airplane entered a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading about 0.5-mile from the intended runway. According to airspeeds calculated from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast position data, the airplane’s calibrated airspeed was 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix inbound toward the runway and was about 84 knots when it was on a 0.5-mile final approach. The airplane continued to decelerate to 74 knots while it was in a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. At no point during the approach did the pilot maintain the airframe manufacturer’s specified approach speed of 85 knots. The airplane impacted the ground in an open grass field located to the left of the extended runway centerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain in a wings level attitude. The postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe altitude and airspeed trends during the final moments of the flight were consistent with the airplane entering an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. Based on the configuration of the airplane at the accident site, the pilot likely was retracting the landing gear and flaps for a go-around when the airplane entered the aerodynamic stall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight, and past the aft center-of-gravity limit at the time of the accident which can render the airplane unstable and difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.  Additionally, without a timely corrective rudder input, the airplane tends to roll left after a rapid application of thrust at airspeeds less than 70 knots, including during aerodynamic stalls. Although an increase in thrust is required for a go-around, the investigation was unable to determine how rapidly the pilot increased thrust, or if a torque-roll occurred during the aerodynamic stall.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Weight and Balance Effects&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook, if the CG is maintained within the allowable limits for an airplane’s weight, the airplane would have adequate longitudinal stability and control. If a loaded airplane results in a CG that is aft of the allowable limits, the airplane can become unstable and would be difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPropeller Thrust-Required Estimates&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller manufacturer provided thrust-required estimates based on the airplane’s weight, altitude, airspeed, and airframe drag. The thrust estimates suggest the powerplant was running, capable of generating thrust, and responding to airframe configuration changes/power lever inputs necessary to maintain the approach path until the final moments of the flight. The average estimated propeller thrust over the final 11 recorded ADS-B data points was 412 lbs. The average flight condition during those final recorded data points were about 1,050 ft pressure altitude and 82 knots true airspeed. Assuming a propeller speed of 2,000 RPM, the engine power required to generate 412 pounds of thrust with those flight conditions is about 170 horsepower (24% torque) at about 15.6° propeller blade angle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSafety Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn February 2014, the French Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA) published a study concerning loss of control accidents involving Socata TBM 700 airplanes. The study reviewed 36 accidents, of which 6 involved a loss of control and left roll during final approach. In several of the accidents, the airplane deviated left of the intended flight path shortly before impact. The accidents generally involved the airplane flying at a low airspeed while in the landing configuration, combined with a rapid increase in thrust. The study highlighted a tendency for the Socata TBM 700 airplane to start rolling to the left, controllably, during go-around while at airspeeds equal to or greater than 70 knots, and from a fully reduced engine torque or adjusted to 20%. However, the left rolling tendency becomes increasingly pronounced as the airspeed decreases below 70 knots. A demonstration flight revealed that without corrective rudder input after a rapid application of thrust the airplane tended to roll to the left during an aerodynamic stall. The study acknowledged that a left roll during an aerodynamic stall is a recognized phenomenon associated with single engine airplanes, and that the Socata TBM 700 airplane design complied with federal regulations that limited how much left roll can be encountered during an aerodynamic stall. The study suggested that additional pilot training at slow airspeeds could be beneficial in preventing similar accidents in the future.&#x0D;\n - Weight and Balance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had a total fuel capacity of 290.6 gallons (281.6 gallons usable). According to available fueling and historical flight information, the airplane had about 202 gallons (1,374 lbs) of fuel onboard before the flight departed. Based on historical fuel consumption data, the airplane used about 70 gallons (476 lbs) during the 58 minute accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the current weight-and-balance record, dated May 24, 2017, the airplane had an empty weight of 4,674.28 lbs and a useful load of 2,719.92 lbs. The empty weight center-of-gravity (CG) was 187.17 inches aft of the datum. At maximum takeoff weight, 7,394 lbs, the forward and aft CG limits were 187 inches and 193.65 inches, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane's weight and balance at takeoff were calculated using the reported weights and seat positions for the pilot and the 5 passengers, and 202 gallons (1,374 lbs) of fuel. The takeoff weight and CG location were estimated to be 7,626.28 lbs and 196.18 inches, respectively. At takeoff, the airplane was about 232 lbs over the maximum allowable takeoff weight and about 2.53 inches past the aft CG limit. The engine burned about 70 gallons (476 lbs) of fuel during the flight. The estimated airplane weight and CG location at the time of impact were 7,150.28 lbs and 196.60 inches, respectively. At impact, the airplane was about 126 lbs over the maximum allowable landing weight and 2.95 inches past the aft CG limit (Figure 4).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Weight and Balance Calculations and Plot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAerodynamic Stall Speed&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Socata TBM 700 C2 Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), Supplement No. 41, the aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps extended for landing is 65 knots. The aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps extended for takeoff is 77 knots. The aerodynamic stall speed at maximum takeoff weight with the landing gear and flaps retracted is 83 knots. The approach speed with flaps in the landing position is 85 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight and past the aft CG limit. The airplane manufacturer provided calculated aerodynamic stall speeds for the airplane using the weight (7,150.28 lbs) and center-of-gravity position (196.60 inches) at the time of the accident. The aerodynamic stall speed was estimated to be about 62 knots with landing gear and flaps extended for landing, 74 knots with the landing gear and flaps extended for takeoff, and 79 knots with the landing gear and flaps retracted.&#x0D;\n - On October 3, 2019, about 0858 eastern daylight time, a Socata TBM 700 C2 airplane, N700AQ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Lansing, Michigan. The commercial pilot and four passengers were fatally injured; and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data, about 0800, the flight departed runway 19 at Indy South Greenwood Airport (HFY), Greenwood, Indiana, turned northeast toward MAREO intersection, and then turned north toward Capital Region International Airport (LAN), Lansing, Michigan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane subsequently climbed to flight level 190 (19,000 ft pressure altitude). At 0834:24, the flight entered a cruise descent from flight level 190 and was progressively cleared down to 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control communications, the flight was provided radar vectors to join the localizer for the instrument landing system (ILS) runway 10R approach at LAN. The published inbound course for the ILS runway 10R approach at LAN was 96° magnetic, the crossing altitude for the final approach fix (FAMLI) was 2,367 ft msl, the distance between FAMLI and the runway 10R threshold was 4.5 miles, and the decision altitude was 1,061 ft msl (200 ft above ground level).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0853:03, the approach controller stated, \"TBM zero alpha quebec, five miles from FAMLI, turn right, ah, right heading zero seven zero, maintain three thousand until established on the localizer, cleared the ILS one zero right.\" The pilot responded, \"zero seven zero, ah, we're cleared for the ILS ten right into, ah, Lansing.\" The ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a right turn and joined the localizer inbound.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0854:27, the approach controller stated, \"TBM zero alpha quebec, contact Lansing tower one one niner point niner, good day.\" The pilot responded, \"One nineteen ninety, seven hundred alpha quebec.\" At 0855:29, the airplane crossed over FAMLI at 2,303 ft msl and continued to descend on the glideslope while established inbound on the localizer toward runway 10R. The airplane had a calculated calibrated airspeed of 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix. Between 0855:29 and 0857:45, while inbound on the instrument approach, the airplane continued to decelerate from 166 knots to 74 knots, as shown in figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Altitude and airspeed during instrument approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0854:36, the pilot established contact with the LAN tower controller and reported that the airplane was established on the ILS runway 10R instrument approach. At 0854:39, the tower controller stated, \"seven zero zero alpha quebec, Lansing, ah, tower, the winds are calm, one zero right cleared to land.\" The pilot responded, \"Cleared to land, ah, ten right, seven hundred alpha quebec.\" There were no additional communications received from the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ADS-B data indicated that at 0857:06 the airplane was about 1.3 miles from the runway threshold at 1,250 ft msl (about 400 ft above the runway elevation) and established on the localizer inbound to the runway. At 0857:37, the airplane was 0.5 miles from the runway threshold at 1,047 ft msl (about 180 ft above the runway elevation) and 84 knots when it entered a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. Between 0857:37 and 0857:45, the airplane climbed to 1,059 ft msl and decelerated to 74 knots, as shown in figure 2. At 0857:45, the final ADS-B datapoint was located about 315 ft north of the localizer centerline and 0.35 miles west of the runway 10R threshold. The final ADS-B datapoint was about 475 ft southwest of the initial impact point with terrain. Figure 3 shows ADS-B position data during the airplane’s final approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Altitude and airspeed during final approach. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. ADS-B position data during final approach.  &#x0D;\n - The pilot received his commercial pilot certificate on May 8, 2019. The pilot’s last instrument proficiency check was completed in a Redbird SR22 simulator on September 12, 2019. He completed the SIMCOM TBM 700 initial course on September 30, 2018. According to the pilot's logbook, he had flown 76.4 hours and 9.8 hours in Socata TBM 700 and TBM 850 airplanes, respectively. The pilot had logged all his Socata TBM 700 flight time during the year before the accident.&#x0D;\n - The accident site was in an open grass field located about 0.3 miles west-northwest of the runway 10R threshold. The initial impact point was in a large, depressed grass area that preceded a 135-ft-long ground scar oriented on a 060° bearing. The initial impact area measured 42 ft wide, consistent with the wingspan of the airplane (figure 5). The lower VHF antenna, the left main landing gear door, and several flap track fairings were located along the wreckage debris path.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Initial impact point and ground scar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Main airplane wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the entire airplane (figure 6). Both wings and the empennage remained attached to the fuselage. All flight control surfaces remained attached to their respective hinges. Flight control continuity for the elevator, rudder, and right aileron were confirmed from each flight control surface to the forward cabin. Flight control continuity to the left aileron could not be established due to impact damage; the observed cable separations near the left wing root were consistent with overstress. Both spoilers were retracted and remained connected to their respective ailerons. Both the rudder and elevator trim surfaces were found in their neutral positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flap selector was found in the up and locked position. The wing flap actuator jack screws were found about halfway between the takeoff and landing positions. The landing gear selector switch was found in the gear-up position. The left main landing gear and nose gear were fully retracted and on their respective actuator uplocks. The right main landing gear was retracted into its wheel well, but the right gear was not secured by its respective actuator uplock.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle was found in the flight idle position, the propeller lever was full forward, and the condition lever was full forward. The fuel manual override was closed and gated. The fuel system switch was found on AUTO, and the engine was using fuel from the left fuel tank at the time of impact. Both fuel tanks ruptured during impact and there was a strong odor of Jet A aviation fuel at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to its respective engine mounts. There was a complete fracture of the propeller shaft and reduction gearbox housing forward of the 2nd stage reduction gears. There was evidence that engine oil was discharged out of the engine after impact; engine oil was found on the outside of the engine cowling, windscreen, and extending 20 ft in front of the engine (Figure 7). There was compressive impact damage to the exhaust case at the 6 o'clock position. Engine control continuity was established from the cockpit to the fuel control unit. The propeller speed setting lever and reset cables were found separated from the propeller governor, but these cables moved freely when the associated cockpit levers were moved by hand. The compressor rotor turned freely with no anomalies and had continuity with the accessory gearbox. Fuel discharged from hoses when the fuel pump was rotated. The fuel filter bowl was about one-half full, and the fuel appeared clear with no significant debris or phase separation. Both magnetic chip detectors were free of any metallic particles. Some minor foreign object debris was found on the leading edge of several first-stage compressor blades and vegetation debris in the inlet screen. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe compressor turbine (CT) and power turbine (PT) were intact with all blades present. There were rotational contact signatures observed on the CT blades downstream platforms from contact with the inner shroud of the upstream side of the 1st stage PT vane ring. The first-stage PT blade tips displayed rubbing, with corresponding rubbing observed on the shroud at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. Some of the upstream blade platforms displayed rubbing with the inner shroud of the downstream side of the first-stage PT vane ring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7. Overview Photo of the Engine and Propeller at Accident Site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller assembly remained attached to the engine propeller shaft that fractured from the engine reduction gear box during impact. One propeller blade was bent in the forward/thrust direction. The remaining three propeller blades were bent in the aft direction. All four propeller blades exhibited chordwise/rotational scoring on the camber side with paint discoloration from the tip to the outboard end of the deice boot. Three blades exhibited chordwise/rotational scoring on the face side. The spinner dome was dented adjacent to one propeller blade with a counterweight impression area with the center/average angle of about 44°. The pitch change rod was in the feathered position. Three propeller blades could be rotated by hand force due to fractured pitch change mechanisms. One propeller blade had been forcefully rotated beyond the reverse stop position, two blades were in a low-pitch position, and one blade was in a feathered position. The beta ring appeared intact and undamaged with the carbon block and beta arm in position. The beta arm and valve moved freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.&#x0D;\n -",
